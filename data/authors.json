    "research_summary": "Abstract Aims/hypothesis Genetic association studies have demonstrated that partial loss of SLC30A8 Function protects against type 2 diabetes in humans. We investigated the impact of complete loss of SLC30A8 Function on type 2 diabetes risk and related phenotypes in humans. Methods The Pakistan Genome Resource (PGR), a biobank comprising whole-exome and whole-genome sequences of 145,037 participants, was analysed for phenotypic associations with SLC30A8 loss-of-function (LoF) variants. To follow up on the observations in the PGR, we conducted recall-by-genotype analyses of SLC30A8 LoF heterozygotes and homozygotes, as well as their participating family members, using OGTTs. Results We identified 18 SLC30A8 knockouts, including homozygotes for a variant enriched in South Asians (Gln174Ter), and 1024 heterozygotes for LoF variants. Type 2 diabetes risk was lower in SLC30A8 LoF heterozygotes and homozygotes relative to non-carriers, and the protective effect strengthens in a gene dose-dependent manner (OR additive =0.62; 95% CI 0.53, 0.72; p =1.1\u00d710 \u20139 ; OR recessive =0.34; 95% CI 0.12, 0.93; p =0.04). OGTTs in recall-by-genotype studies showed a gene dose-dependent reduction in glucose levels, coupled with elevated insulin. Conclusions/interpretation The corrected insulin response, disposition index and insulin sensitivity index in LoF heterozygotes and homozygotes indicated higher glucose-stimulated insulin secretion with preserved beta cell function that was independent of BMI. These data suggest that therapeutic inhibition of SLC30A8 , up to and including complete knockout, may treat type 2 diabetes safely and effectively. Graphical Abstract Abstract Cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) is involved in metabolising over 20% of clinical drugs, yet its genetic variation across ancestries is underexplored in large-scale whole-genome sequencing (WGS) datasets. We analysed WGS data from 479,144 UK Biobank participants, identifying 95 distinct CYP2D6 star alleles across five biogeographic groups. Of these, 48 alleles had currently unknown effects. These alleles were more prevalent in African, admixed American, and South Asian groups (\u223c5%) compared to European and East Asian groups (\u223c2%), affecting the ability to provide pharmacogenomics recommendations across ancestries. We identified 99,656 (20.8%) individuals carrying CYP2D6 structural variations and predicted the CYP2D6 ultra-rapid metaboliser phenotype to be most common in Africans (4.5%) and rarest in East Asians (0.32%). Less than half (45.7%) of rare protein-truncating variant carriers were categorised as poor or intermediate metabolisers, indicating an underrepresentation of rare functional variants in the current CYP2D6 star allele evaluation. Phenome-wide association studies confirmed links with narcotic allergies and found new associations with plasma BAFFR and BAFF proteins, offering insights for the BAFF-targeted clinical therapy. Collectively, this largest WGS study of CYP2D6 to date highlights the importance of leveraging all genetic variations for pharmacogenomic insights affecting therapeutic safety and development."

    "research_summary": "Efficient cache management is critical for optimizing the system performance, and numerous caching mechanisms have been proposed, each exploring various insertion and eviction strategies. In this paper, we present AdaptiveClimb and its extension, DynamicAdaptiveClimb, two novel cache replacement policies that leverage lightweight, cache adaptation to outperform traditional approaches. Unlike classic Least Recently Used (LRU) and Incremental Rank Progress (CLIMB) policies, AdaptiveClimb dynamically adjusts the promotion distance (jump) of the cached objects based on recent hit and miss patterns, requiring only a single tunable parameter and no per-item statistics. This enables rapid adaptation to changing access distributions while maintaining low overhead. Building on this foundation, DynamicAdaptiveClimb further enhances adaptability by automatically tuning the cache size in response to workload demands. Our comprehensive evaluation across a diverse set of real-world traces, including 1067 traces from 6 different datasets, demonstrates that DynamicAdaptiveClimb consistently achieves substantial speedups and higher hit ratios compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. In particular, our approach achieves up to a 29% improvement in hit ratio and a substantial reduction in miss penalties compared to the FIFO baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the next-best contenders, AdaptiveClimb and SIEVE [43], by approximately 10% to 15%, especially in environments characterized by fluctuating working set sizes. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in delivering efficient performance, making it well-suited for modern, dynamic caching environments."

    "research_summary": "Effective conservation genomics of endangered species requires realistic understanding of the fitness consequences caused by the accumulation of deleterious mutations in declining populations. We experimentally investigated three mutations which have been bioinformatically predicted to be deleterious in the mitochondrial ND5 subunit of respiratory complex I and are fixed in the Apennine brown bear, an inbred population of about 50 individuals isolated in Central Italy. Functional assays in transfected cell models and fibroblasts demonstrated that the G527E substitution significantly reduces mitochondrial transmembrane potential and calcium uptake by ca. 40 and 25% of the control level, respectively, while increasing reactive oxygen species production by ca. 45%. While further confirming these findings, experiments with bear fibroblasts highlighted lower oxygen consumption and impaired mitochondrial turnover in the Apennine bear. Molecular dynamics simulations uncovered structural effects of the G527E substitution, including increased rigidity of the ND5 and associated NDUFB8 subunits and altered hydration dynamics in key aqueous channels of the complex I which are essential for proton pumping. These findings validate previous bioinformatic predictions of the negative fitness effects for one out of three mtDNA mutations, and elucidate the molecular mechanisms behind compromised bioenergetics in this endangered bear population produced by the G527E substitution. By linking genotype to phenotype via advanced molecular biology tools in a non-model species of conservation concern, this study highlights the need to fully integrate genomics and molecular experimental approaches in modern conservation biology. Abstract Motivation Rare diseases collectively affect 5% of the population. However, fewer than 50% of rare disease patients receive a molecular diagnosis after whole genome sequencing. Supervised machine learning is a valuable approach for the pathogenicity scoring of human genetic variants. However, existing methods are often trained on curated but limited central repositories, resulting in poor accuracy when tested on external cohorts. Yet, large collections of variants generated at hospitals and research institutions remain inaccessible to machine-learning purposes because of privacy and legal constraints. Federated learning (FL) algorithms have been recently developed enabling institutions to collaboratively train models without sharing their local datasets. Results Here, we present a proof-of-concept study evaluating the effectiveness of FL for the clinical classification of genetic variants. A comprehensive array of diverse FL strategies was assessed for coding and non-coding Single Nucleotide Variants as well as Copy Number Variants. Our results showed that federated models generally achieved comparable or superior performance to traditional centralized learning. In addition, federated models reached a robust generalization to independent sets with smaller data fractions as compared to their centralized model counterparts. Our findings support the adoption of FL to establish secure multi-institutional collaborations in human variant interpretation.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently seen transformative breakthroughs in the life sciences, expanding possibilities for researchers to interpret biological information at an unprecedented capacity, with novel applications and advances being made almost daily. In order to maximise return on the growing investments in AI-based life science research and accelerate this progress, it has become urgent to address the exacerbation of long-standing research challenges arising from the rapid adoption of AI methods. We review the increased erosion of trust in AI research outputs, driven by the issues of poor reusability and reproducibility, and highlight their consequent impact on environmental sustainability. Furthermore, we discuss the fragmented components of the AI ecosystem and lack of guiding pathways to best support Open and Sustainable AI (OSAI) model development. In response, this perspective introduces a practical set of OSAI recommendations directly mapped to over 300 components of the AI ecosystem. Our work connects researchers with relevant AI resources, facilitating the implementation of sustainable, reusable and transparent AI. Built upon life science community consensus and aligned to existing efforts, the outputs of this perspective are designed to aid the future development of policy and structured pathways for guiding AI implementation. Abstract Predicting protein stability changes upon single\u2010point mutations is crucial in computational biology, with applications in drug design, enzyme engineering, and understanding"

    "research_summary": "Background: Parents caring for preterm infants during hospital admission have unique needs. How these are addressed plays an important role in parents\u2019 ability to cope with caregiving responsibilities. Educational programmes have proven beneficial to parents during their infant\u2019s stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), for both parental and neonatal outcomes. Key components of parenting education during the NICU stay have been described; however, less is known about our understanding of parents\u2019 educational needs, specifically in the South African context. Objectives: To explore parental needs and perceptions regarding a parenting education intervention provided to them while in the NICU, with a focus on programme content, structure, and mode of delivery. Methods: Three focus group discussions were conducted with mothers of preterm infants admitted to the NICU of a referral hospital in the North West province, South Africa. Inclusion criteria comprised parents of infants born in the hospital, singletons or multiples, with a gestational age below 37 weeks, and expected to stay in the NICU for at least 7 days. Discussions centred on mothers\u2019 perceived needs regarding parenting education based on their experiences during their baby\u2019s NICU admission. Results: Twenty-five mothers of singletons or multiples born before 37 weeks of gestation participated in the study. Three main themes were identified: (1) preference for content topics to include basic infant care, infant health and behaviours, and post-discharge related information; (2) education programme structure, which included instructional approaches and training logistics; and (3) support needs, including intrapersonal motivators, communication, and psychosocial and physical support. Conclusions: Participants recognised educational content needs that align with existing literature. However, they also emphasised the importance of addressing basic physical and emotional needs while receiving educational content, ensuring that parents feel empowered and capable of engaging with the information. ABSTRACT The availability of ultra\u2010low\u2010field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to improve neuroimaging accessibility in low\u2010resource settings. However, the utility of ULF MRI in detecting child brain changes associated with anemia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the comparability of 3T high\u2010field (HF) and 64mT ULF volumes in infants for brain regions associated with antenatal maternal anemia. This neuroimaging substudy is nested within Khula South Africa, a population\u2010based birth cohort. Pregnant women were enrolled antenatally and postnatally, and mother\u2013child dyads ( n = 394) were followed prospectively at approximately 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. A subgroup of infants was scanned on 3T and 64mT MRI systems across study visits and images were segmented using MiniMORPH. Correlations and concordance coefficients were used to cross\u2010validate HF and ULF infant brain volumes for the caudate nucleus, putamen, and corpus callosum. Seventy\u2010eight children (53.85% male) had paired HF (mean [SD] age = 9.64 [5.26] months) and ULF (mean [SD] age = 9.47 [5.32] months) datasets. Results indicated strong agreement between systems for intracranial volume (ICV; r = 0.96, \u03c1 ccc = 0.95) and brain regions of interest in anemia including the caudate nucleus ( r = 0.89, \u03c1 ccc = 0.86), putamen ( r = 0.97, \u03c1 ccc = 0.96) and corpus callosum ( r = 0.87, \u03c1 ccc = 0.79). This cross\u2010validation study demonstrates excellent correspondence between 3T and 64mT volumes for infant brain regions implicated in antenatal maternal anemia. Findings validate the use of ULF MRI for pediatric neuroimaging on anemia in Africa. Abstract We asked whether infant microbiome composition, together with infants\u2019 behavioral responses to early maternal unpredictability, can offer novel mechanistic insights into behavioral phenotypic variation in human development. Maternal unpredictability was computed as the entropy rate of transitions among maternal sensory signals during naturalistic mother-infant interaction ( n =256 dyads; 2-6 months). Infant visual orienting behavior (VOB) was indexed by infants\u2019 simultaneous gaze shifts to and from the mother. Higher maternal unpredictability predicted more frequent VOB shifts, indicating a mature-for-age profile, and longitudinally forecast poorer inhibitory control at 19-28 months. A subgroup of infants with high maternal unpredictability and high VOB had inhibitory control outcomes closer to those of infants who experienced low maternal unpredictability, suggesting VOB strategy might buffer against the effects of high maternal unpredictability. In participants with metagenomic data ( n =93), VOB was associated with taxonomic and functional gut microbial profiles along a Bifidobacterium breve to Bifidobacterium longum axis. Neuroactive gene-set enrichment analysis linked VOB to increase in tryptophan synthesis and glutamate synthesis g"

    "research_summary": "Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution (LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS) strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations. Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word and synthetic LF datasets."

    "research_summary": "Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node), PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4 percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models, advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings. Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC) therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression. Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance. Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly, followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset. By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically exclusive, and topologically consistent."

    "research_summary": "&lt;div&gt;Abstract&lt;p&gt;MicroRNAs are strongly implicated in such processes as development, carcinogenesis, cell survival, and apoptosis. It is likely, therefore, that they can also modulate sensitivity and resistance to anticancer drugs in substantial ways. To test this hypothesis, we studied the pharmacologic roles of three microRNAs previously implicated in cancer biology (let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21) and also used in silico methods to test pharmacologic microRNA effects more broadly. In the experimental system, we increased the expression of individual microRNAs by transfecting their precursors (which are active) or suppressed the expression by transfection of antisense oligomers. In three NCI-60 human cancer cell lines, a panel of 60 lines used for anticancer drug discovery, we assessed the growth-inhibitory potencies of 14 structurally diverse compounds with known anticancer activities. Changing the cellular levels of let-7i, mir-16, and mir-21 affected the potencies of a number of the anticancer agents by up to 4-fold. The effect was most prominent with mir-21, with 10 of 28 cell-compound pairs showing significant shifts in growth-inhibitory activity. Varying mir-21 levels changed potencies in opposite directions depending on compound class; indicating that different mechanisms determine toxic and protective effects. In silico comparison of drug potencies with microRNA expression profiles across the entire NCI-60 panel revealed that \u223c30 microRNAs, including mir-21, show highly significant correlations with numerous anticancer agents. Ten of those microRNAs have already been implicated in cancer biology. Our results support a substantial role for microRNAs in anticancer drug response, suggesting novel potential approaches to the improvement of chemotherapy.

The NCI-60, a panel of 60 diverse human cancer cell lines, has been used by the National Cancer Institute to screen &gt;100,000 chemical compounds and natural product extracts for anticancer activity. The NCI-60 has also been profiled for mRNA and protein expression, mutational status, chromosomal aberrations, and DNA copy number, generating an unparalleled public resource for integrated chemogenomic studies. Recently, microRNAs have been shown to target particular sets of mRNAs, thereby preventing translation or accelerating mRNA turnover. To complement the existing NCI-60 data sets, we have measured expression levels of microRNAs in the NCI-60 and incorporated the resulting data into the CellMiner program package for integrative analysis. Cell line groupings based on microRNA expression were generally consistent with tissue type and with cell line clustering based on mRNA expression. However, mRNA expression seemed to be somewhat more informative for discriminating among tissue types than was microRNA expression. In addition, we found that there does not seem to be a significant correlation between microRNA expression patterns and those of known target transcripts. Comparison of microRNA expression patterns and compound potency patterns showed significant correlations, suggesting that microRNAs may play a role in chemoresistance. Combined with gene expression and other biological data using multivariate analysis, microRNA expression profiles may provide a critical link for understanding mechanisms involved in chemosensitivity and chemoresistance.

    "research_summary": "International audience Cluster analysis is widely used in the areas of machine learning and data\\nmining. Fuzzy clustering is a particular method that considers that a data\\npoint can belong to more than one cluster. Fuzzy clustering helps obtain\\nflexible clusters, as needed in such applications as text categorization. The\\nperformance of a clustering algorithm critically depends on the number of\\nclusters, and estimating the optimal number of clusters is a challenging task.\\nQuality indices help estimate the optimal number of clusters. However, there is\\nno quality index that can obtain an accurate number of clusters for different\\ndatasets. Thence, in this paper, we propose a new cluster quality index\\nassociated with a visual, graph-based solution that helps choose the optimal\\nnumber of clusters in fuzzy partitions. Moreover, we validate our theoretical\\nresults through extensive comparison experiments against state-of-the-art\\nquality indices on a variety of numerical real-world and artificial datasets.\\n"

    "research_summary": "Introduction Given insulin resistance\u2019s (IR) critical role in metabolic pathophysiology, this study aims to identify optimal coffee consumption patterns by timing and dose to improve population health. Material and methods Multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic splines assessed associations between coffee timing, dosage, and IR (measured by estimated glucose disposal rate) from NHANES data (1999\u20132018). Interaction and subgroup analyses explored variations across population segments. Results We analysed 21,138 participants, of whom 46.79% were non-consumers. Among consumers, 76% primarily drank coffee in the morning. Morning consumption at the lowest quartile (Q1) showed significant improvement in IR (odds ratio [OR] = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.16\u20131.62), although this benefit diminished with higher consumption levels (p &lt; 0.05). While the \u201call-day\u201d pattern overall showed a non-significant trend toward improved insulin resistance (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.83\u20131.73), higher consumption within this pattern (Q3: OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.89; Q4: OR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.11\u20131.63) proved significantly more beneficial than lower intake. Comparative analysis revealed that morning consumption tended to be more advantageous for low-to-moderate intake (Q1-Q2), whereas all-day distribution showed potential benefits at higher consumption levels (Q3-Q4). The observed benefits were primarily associated with caffeinated coffee, attenuated by sugar addition, and varied across subgroups based on age, sex, and comorbidities. Conclusions Both morning and all-day coffee intake improve IR. For moderate consumption (1\u20132 cups/day), morning intake provides optimal improvement in insulin sensitivity. For higher intake (\u2265 3 cups/day), distributed consumption is more effective. These findings support chrono-nutrition principles for optimising metabolic health through coffee consumption. Abstract Electron beam lithography (EBL) is one of the most important technologies for fabricating high-precision nano structures for nano optics. However, the exposure process on insulating substrates is significantly hindered by charging effects, which induce severe pattern distortion. The common solution for charge accumulation is to add a conductive layer, but the position and material of this layer have not been systematically studied. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation into these two aspects, single or dual conductive layers on different positions and polymer or metal on the different materials. Through comparative experiment and quantitative analysis on the fidelity of shape and dimension, we find that the conductive layer beneath the resist provides significantly better charge dissipation compared to those placed above. Furthermore, metal conductive layers deposited above the resist are found to introduce structure distortion. These findings provide new insights for optimizing EBL process on insulating substrates and offer significant practical guidance for the reliable fabrication of complex nano structures. Abstract The catalytic asymmetric Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions of (hetero)arenes represent a cornerstone in synthetic chemistry due to their ability to efficiently incorporate aromatic rings into complex molecular architectures. This account presents a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in the catalytic enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts reactions of (hetero)arenes, with a particular focus on reactions that facilitate the introduction of aromatic rings into multiple C\u2013C bonds via iranium/irenium-ion-triggered electrophilic processes. We examine in detail the strategies and methodologies employed to achieve stereoselective incorporation of (hetero)arenes into unsaturated C\u2013C bonds, highlighting the construction of diverse structural scaffolds. Additionally, this account showcases the broad range of applications of this powerful transformation in organic synthesis. 1 Introduction 2 Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions via Thiiranium/Thiirenium Ions 2.1 Arylthiiranium/Arylthiirenium-Ion-Triggered Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions 2.2 Trifluoromethylthiiranium/Trifluoromethylthiirenium-Ion-Triggered Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions 3 Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions via Haliranium Ions 3.1 Chloriranium-Ion-Triggered Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions 3.2 Bromiranium-Ion-Triggered Catalytic Enantioselective Friedel\u2013Crafts Reactions 3.3 Iodiranium-Ion-Triggered Catalytic Asymmetric Oxidative Arylation of Alkenes 4 Conclusion and Outlook PPIs delivered over four weeks significantly enhance quality of life and psychological outcomes in first-episode depression, supporting clinical adoption."

    "research_summary": "In recent years, cyberattacks have increased in sophistication, using a variety of tools to exploit vulnerabilities across the global digital landscapes. Among the most commonly used tools at an attacker\u2019s disposal are Google dorks, Shodan, and Censys, which offer unprecedented access to exposed systems, devices, and sensitive data on the World Wide Web. While these tools can be leveraged by professional hackers, they have also empowered \u201cScript Kiddies\u201d, who are low-skill, inexperienced attackers who use readily available exploits and scanning tools without deep technical knowledge. Consequently, cyberattacks targeting critical infrastructure are growing at a rapid rate, driven by the ease with which these solutions can be operated with minimal expertise. This paper explores the potential for cyberattacks enabled by these tools, presenting use cases where these platforms have been used for both offensive and defensive purposes. By examining notable incidents and analyzing potential threats, we outline proactive measures to protect against these emerging risks. In this study, we delve into how these tools have been used offensively by attackers and how they serve defensive functions within cybersecurity. Additionally, we also introduce an automated all-in-one tool designed to consolidate the functionalities of Google dorks, Shodan, and Censys, offering a streamlined solution for vulnerability detection and analysis. Lastly, we propose proactive defense strategies to mitigate exploitation risks associated with such tools, aiming to enhance the resilience of critical digital infrastructure against evolving cyber threats."

    "research_summary": "Uneven terrains and complex obstacles in off-road environments present significant challenges to the stability and safety of vehicle path planning. This paper presents a hierarchical DRL-DWA path planning framework for unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs). At the global level, an energy-aware D* Lite algorithm generates cost-efficient waypoints considering both distance and energy consumption. At the local level, a deep reinforcement learning-enhanced DWA controller adaptively adjusts the weighting factors of evaluation functions in real time to ensure dynamic feasibility on rough terrain. The parameter selection is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), where a novel reward function based on elevation maps, vehicle pose, goal, and obstacle information guides the optimization for off-road navigation. Furthermore, the single UGV framework is extended to a multi-UGV system, where formation control is achieved through the leader\u2013follower strategy. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we conduct experiments in 3D simulation environments featuring various terrains and obstacles. The results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms existing path planning techniques, showing a higher success rate and a lower average elevation gradient in uneven terrains."

    "research_summary": "Abstract A synchrotron radiation beamline BL13U is under commissioning at NanoTerasu, the new 3 GeV high-brilliance synchrotron radiation facility at Tohoku, Japan. BL13U is dedicated for wide-energy-range X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in the soft to tender X-ray energy region (180-3000 eV) with versatile polarization control for x-ray magnetic circular/linear dichroism (XMCD/XMLD) measurements. The beamline optics are designed for balancing high photon flux and energy resolution. BL13U has achieved an energy resolution E/ \u0394 E above 10000 at 400 eV, as well as sharp X-ray absorption spectra both in the soft X-ray and tender X-ray region from Boron K ( \u223c 190 eV) to Ruthenium L 2 ( \u223c 2970 eV) edges. The intertwined coupling among various many-body interactions is increasingly recognized as playing a key role in strongly correlated electron systems. However, understanding their relationship to physical properties is challenging due to the lack of a definitive experimental measure. Here, we report an analytical approach that utilizes machine learning to enable a higher level of evaluation of many-body interactions through a large amount of data from a single material using spatially resolved and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We demonstrate that various physical parameters, including the coupling strengths of electron-electron and electron-boson interactions, can be statistically evaluated, and the correlation between many-body interactions can also be accessed. Our approach thus provides a quantitative measure of the microscopic variables and serves as a linking bridge between them, holding great promise in disentangling the complex nature of strongly correlated materials where many-body interactions generally mutually interplay. Abstract The degree of anisotropy and the domain arrangement of crystal structures in ferroelectrics are affected by the grain boundaries and by the shape and size of the grains. To understand the grain boundary effects that occur in ferroelectric ceramics, we introduce a technique for nondestructively observing the internal lattice strain distribution of a submicrometer-sized ferroelectric grain in polycrystalline materials. The ferroelectric phase transition of a single grain in the polycrystalline materials was evaluated by tracking the changes in the Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction (CXD) patterns. The internal lattice strain distribution of the grains in the paraelectric phase was visualized via Bragg CXD imaging. A pair of 90\u00b0 domains in the ferroelectric phase were also imaged in three dimensions, and showed a domain boundary correlated with the internal lattice strain caused by the stresses from the adjacent grains. Abstract A synchrotron radiation beamline in the soft- and tender-X ray energy range of 180-3000 eV with versatile polarization control has been designed for NanoTerasu, the 3-GeV next-generation synchrotron radiation facility at Tohoku, Japan. A series of four APPLE-II type undulators is adopted as a photon source to realize the required beam properties with high-speed polarization switching. The beamline optics is designed for a highly efficient and precise use of x-ray magnetic circular/linear dichroism (XMCD/XMLD) technique balancing high photon flux and energy resolution. The simulated performance of the segmented undulator together with the monochromator optics achieved the sufficiently high flux and energy resolution ( E/\u0394E ) in whole target energy range. Two endstations with the different re-focus optics, one for marginal spot size with high flux and the other for ultimate focus down to \u223c10 nm are also designed. The simulated performance of the beamline encourages the future researches of high-throughput and nm-focused spintronic measurements."

    "research_summary": "The increasing complexity of deepfake technology poses a serious threat to digital media integrity and strong detection and explanation mechanisms are needed. This project presents a complete system that detects not only deepfake videos but also gives detailed, interpretable explanations to support user understanding and trust. The detection pipeline integrates an InceptionV3-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for modeling temporal sequences, enabling accurate classification of video content as real or fake. Facial feature segmentation is performed using the CelebAMask-HQ model to highlight specific facial regions, while Grad-CAM is applied to visualize areas of high influence in the model's decision-making. Another new addition to the system is the integration of Gemini AI, which generates natural language explanations based on technical metrics such as confidence scores, face consistency, and temporal anomalies. The complete system is deployed via a Streamlit interface, offering an intuitive platform for users to upload videos and receive both technical and AI-powered insights. This work advances the field of explainable deepfake detection by combining deep learning, visual interpretation, and natural language explanation in a unified, user-friendly framework. Key Words: Deepfake detection, Explainable AI , InceptionV3, GRU, CelebAMask-HQ, Grad-CAM, Gemini analysis, Streamlit interface. Purpose: An Electrocardiogram (ECG) is the simplest and fastest bio-medical test that is used to detect any heart-related disease. ECG signals are generally stored in paper form, which makes it difficult to store and analyze the data. While capturing ECG leads from paper ECG records, a lot of background information is also captured, which results in incorrect data interpretation. Methods: We propose a deep learning-based model for individually extracting all 12 leads from 12-lead ECG images captured using a camera. To simplify the analysis of the ECG and the calculation of complex parameters, we also propose a method to convert the paper ECG format into a storable digital format. The You Only Look Once, Version 3 (YOLOv3) algorithm has been used to extract the leads present in the image. These leads are then passed on to another deep learning model which separates the ECG signal and background from the single-lead image. After that, vertical scanning is performed on the ECG signal to convert it into a 1-Dimensional (1D) digital form. To perform the task of digitalization, we used the pix-2-pix deep learning model and binarized the ECG signals. Results: Our proposed method was able to achieve an accuracy of 97.4 %. Conclusion: The information on the paper ECG fades away over time. Hence, the digitized ECG signals make it possible to store the records and access them anytime. This proves highly beneficial for heart patients who require frequent ECG reports. The stored data can also be useful for research purposes, as this data can be used to develop computer algorithms that are capable of analyzing the data. Abstract: Visual secret sharing (VSS) systems hide hidden images in shares that are also published on clarity or decrypted and saved in digital form. The shares can seem as noise-like pixels or as meaningful images, but this will raise suspicion and increase the risk of interception during transmission. As a result, VSS schemes face a transmission danger problem for both the secret and the individuals involved in the VSS system. To solve this issue, we presented a new palette-grounded steganography technique that uses a texture with LSB, as well as a natural-image-grounded VSS scheme (NVSS scheme) that shares secret images via colored carrier media to hide the secret and the actors during the transmission phase. To conceal secret messages, we convert the texture conflation process into steganography. Rather than using a being cover image to conceal dispatches, our algorithm conceals the source texture image and embeds hidden dispatches during the printing process. Prints or hand-painted filmland in digital or published form can be used for the natural shares. We also propose possible methods for concealing the secret in order to reduce the transmission threat problem for the share. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is an excellent solution to the transmission threat problem for VSS schemes. Keywords: visual secret sharing (VSS), steganography, natural-image-based VSS scheme (NVSS scheme), OR Code, Palette Based Steganography Abstract: Conventional visual secret sharing (VSS) schemes hide secret images in shares that are moreover published on clarity or are decoded and stored in a digital form. The shares can appear as noise-suchlike pixels or as meaningful images, but it'll arouse dubitation and increase interception threat during transmission of the shares. Hence, VSS schemes suffer from a transmission threat problem for the sec"

    "research_summary": "Expertise in early detection against intimidating devastation using preventive procedure is an extremely challenging mission of this modern civilization. Sudden increases in the number of cases of disease threaten public health security. Guiding the public for the period of emergency situations plays a crucial role and this procedure saves countless lives. In this paper, we have developed a predictive model. When Epidemic predicted earlier on a proper and speedy response, the losses can be mitigated with the help of learning technology in AI. We proposed a comprehensive framework for the Epidemic management system which employs cumulated knowledge base construction through Machine Learning and Non-Deterministic Finite Automata technique. In this investigation, Real-time data acquisition, sharing accurate information and precise decision making are greatly augmented. This proposed model will enhance the government agencies and responders to act upon at all outbreaks. Prophecy about an imminent event is called prediction. This prediction can be used to equip with preparedness to face an event and come out successful by making right decisions at right time. To automate this process many machine learning algorithms which can predict with varying degrees with each having its own uniqueness. This paper introduces one such novel technique for prediction. This new technique encompasses the knowledge of the domain experts into single formulae and translates that formula into a state transition diagram which will predict the outcome of an event when given with new test parameters of an event. The prediction of an event from this algorithm will be dichotomy in nature and the parameters can also be weighted and also to detect the significance of the model canonical correlation technique is implemented. Security ought to be the highest concern for everyone\u2019s sovereignty from prospective destruction caused by unusual incidents or intruders. Constant monitoring mostly refers to protection against hostile forces. Home security confirms smart decision making at the peak time, activated alarms and detectors are to be avail 24/7. Highest inspiration of this proposed system is to notify the emergency incidents to the appropriate authorities like fire station, police station and the residence owner if the owner is not in house. To prove the domino effect support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms are implemented and tested. In this paper we explore close watch and stay connected devices and also peace of mind through controlling and monitoring our homes by adopting Fog/Edge computing technologies."

    "research_summary": "Parental and child noncompliance are significant behavioral challenges that impact family dynamics, communication, and child development. Parental noncompliance often arises from factors such as mis-trust, stress, or conflicting beliefs, leading to resistance against professional guidance in healthcare, ed-ucation, and child-rearing. Conversely, children\u2019s noncompliance is frequently a natural expression of their growing need for independence, emotional regulation, and boundary exploration. When both forms of noncompliance collide, they create cycles of miscommunication and behavioral challenges that can disrupt family harmony and hinder developmental progress. This article explores the underly-ing causes, consequences, and strategies for addressing noncompliance within families. Key approach-es include fostering trust, enhancing communication, maintaining consistency in parenting techniques, and utilizing positive reinforcement to encourage cooperative behavior. Moreover, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) offers transformative solutions to manage non-compliance. AI-driven predictive analytics, virtual assistants, emotion recognition, and personalized interventions provide data-driven insights that help parents tailor their approach to children\u2019s behavior-al needs. These technologies also enable real-time guidance, improve communication, and enhance compliance through gamification and interactive learning. By merging traditional parenting strategies with AI-enhanced behavioral solutions, families can navigate noncompliance more effectively, foster-ing a cooperative and supportive environment. Ultimately, bridging the gap between parental and child resistance requires a combination of human empathy and AI-driven insights to create stronger, more harmonious family relationships. Understanding the interaction of light with biological tissues is crucial for advancing medical imaging, laser therapies, and infrared spectroscopy applications. This article compares the penetration of Near-Infrared (NIR) and Mid-Infrared (MIR) light in biological tissues, analyzing their behavior through mathematical models and Monte Carlo simulations. The study explores the impact of absorption, scattering, and skin color variations on light penetration depth, providing insights into the optimal wavelength selection for medical and biomedical applications."

    "research_summary": "In the world one of the most prevalent developmental diseases is autism. It is a chronic illness for which there is now no known treatment. In general manner it is the result of a neurological disorder that shows how the brain functions. Children with autism are typically self-absorbed and seem to live in their own worlds, making it difficult for them to interact and connect with others. Sometimes, they struggle to understand what people are saying to them and to learn how to interact with others. The use of visual aid is one of the most strongly suggested ways of teaching autistic youngsters. Games, by their very nature, provide flexibility, the ability to learn from failures, and the ability to adapt to new difficulties and expectations. They have been demonstrated to be one of the most successful tools for autistic people. The proposed system is designed to tackle Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using the gaming approach. The aim is to provide age-targeted gameplay, which includes targeting specific skills for certain, age groups with levels in each game. Also providing a reward system, with tokens or a visual mark of achievement, makes the game more interesting and engaging to play, hence children perform better."

With huge quantities of data being generated every alternate from business deals, client logs and stakeholders, data acts as an imperative pillar that drives various firms. In this scenario, it is impossible to study the entire data population to draw conclusions that can help the business. Inferences drawn from the samples are intended to be generalized to the population, and sometimes to the future as well. Sampling is a statistical process that is concerned with the selection of the individual observation. It helps us to make statistical hypotheticals about the population. Sampling ensures convenience, collection of intensive and exhaustive data, suitability in limited resources and better rapport and it permits you to draw decisions about very complex situations."

    "research_summary": "Accurate stock market forecasting remains a challenging task due to the unpredictable and volatile nature of financial data. Traditional methods like candlestick chart analysis have helped traders interpret market trends visually, but they often lack predictive capability. In this study, we propose a hybrid model that integrates candlestick pattern recognition with the Prophet algorithm\u2014 a time-series forecasting tool developed by Facebook. The model is trained on historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data from the NIFTY 50 index, with an emphasis on capturing both short- term volatility and long-term seasonality. . By detecting key candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Engulfing, Hammer) and combining them with Prophet\u2019s seasonality-aware forecasting engine, the system generates actionable buy/sell signals. The results indicate improved prediction accuracy compared to traditional pattern-only methods. This approach bridges the gap between classic technical analysis and modern AI forecasting, offering a more data-driven and adaptable tool for traders and investors operating in the Indian stock market.

    "research_summary": "While we pay attention to the latest advances in clinical natural language processing (NLP), we can notice some resistance in the clinical and translational research community to adopt NLP models due to limited transparency, interpretability, and usability. In this study, we proposed an open natural language processing development framework. We evaluated it through the implementation of NLP algorithms for the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). Based on the interests in information extraction from COVID-19 related clinical notes, our work includes 1) an open data annotation process using COVID-19 signs and symptoms as the use case, 2) a community-driven ruleset composing platform, and 3) a synthetic text data generation workflow to generate texts for information extraction tasks without involving human subjects. The corpora were derived from texts from three different institutions (Mayo Clinic, University of Kentucky, University of Minnesota). The gold standard annotations were tested with a single institution's (Mayo) ruleset. This resulted in performances of 0.876, 0.706, and 0.694 in F-scores for Mayo, Minnesota, and Kentucky test datasets, respectively. The study as a consortium effort of the N3C NLP subgroup demonstrates the feasibility of creating a federated NLP algorithm development and benchmarking platform to enhance multi-institution clinical NLP study and adoption. Although we use COVID-19 as a use case in this effort, our framework is general enough to be applied to other domains of interest in clinical NLP."

    "research_summary": "The FR-GESTURE dataset consists of 3312 RGBD pairs corresponding to 12 hand signals for guiding UGVs in first response scenarios. It was captured by two Intel RealSense depth cameras positioned in two different heights (low and high) with arbitrary perception angle. Each participant was asked to perform each gesture at 6 or 7 different distances, to increase diversity and therefore make the classifiers robust to multi-distance gesture recognition. Two experimental protocols are introduced: Uniform protocol (uniform_protocol_3312.json): The samples are randomly distributed into train/val/test partitions, with 2304/504/504 samples respectively. The classes within each split are equally distributed to avoid issues due to class imbalance. Subject independent protocol (subject_independent_protocol_3312.json): This protocol aims to evaluate the generalization ability of the models to unseen subjects. Each split contains instances performed by different signers (who do not participate in more than one split). The train (s2, s3, s4, s5, s6), val (s1) and test (s0) splits contain 2304, 504 and 504 samples, respectively. Information for each sample (including camera height and approximate distance) can be found in the entire dataset json (entire_dataset_3312.json). The Classes folder contains the definition of each class. The dataset was collected in the context of TRIFFID project [1] and related study on vision-based gesture recognition [2].

    "research_summary": "Hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) will play a part in decarbonizing the global energy system<sup>1</sup>. However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 \u00b1 4 (refs. <sup>2-5</sup>). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H<sub>2</sub> use under future hydrogen economies<sup>3,5</sup>. A comprehensive accounting of H<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010-2020. H<sub>2</sub> sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H<sub>2</sub> production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H<sub>2</sub>. Estimated global H<sub>2</sub> sources and sinks averaged 69.9 \u00b1 9.4 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup> and 68.4 \u00b1 18.1 Tg yr<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, for 2010-2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H<sub>2</sub>, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H<sub>2</sub> emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H<sub>2</sub> between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 \u00b1 0.006 \u00b0C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H<sub>2</sub> in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01-0.05 \u00b0C, depending on H<sub>2</sub> usage, leakage rates and CH<sub>4</sub> emissions that influence photochemical H<sub>2</sub> production. Abstract. Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data. Emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are estimated by bookkeeping models based on land-use and land-use change data. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured at surface stations, and the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The global net uptake of CO2 by the ocean (SOCEAN, called the ocean sink) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2-products. The global net uptake of CO2 by the land (SLAND, called the land sink) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, ocean interior observation-based estimates, and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as \u00b11\u03c3. For the year 2024, EFOS increased by 1.1 % relative to 2023, with fossil emissions at 10.3 \u00b1 0.5 GtC yr\u22121 (including the cement carbonation sink, 0.2 GtC/yr), ELUC was 1.3 \u00b1 0.7 GtC yr\u22121, for total anthropogenic CO2 emissions of 11.6 \u00b1 0.9 GtC yr\u22121 (42.4 \u00b1 3.2 GtCO2 yr\u22121). Also, for 2024, GATM was 7.9 \u00b1 0.2 GtC yr\u22121 (3.73 \u00b1 0.1 ppm yr\u22121), 2.2 GtC above the 2023 growth rate. SOCEAN was 3.4 \u00b1 0.4 GtC yr\u22121 and SLAND was 1.9 \u00b1 1.1 GtC yr\u22121, leaving a large negative BIM (\u22121.7 GtC yr\u22121), suggesting that the total sink or GATM is strongly overestimated in 2024. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration averaged over 2024 reached 422.8 \u00b1 0.1 ppm. Preliminary data for 2025 suggest an increase in EFOS relative to 2024 of +1.1 % (0.2 % to 2.2 %) globally, and atmospheric CO2 concentration increasing by 2.3 ppm reaching 425.7 ppm, 52 % above the pre-industrial level (around 278 ppm in 1750). Overall, the mean and trend in the components of the global carbon budget are consistently estimated over the period 1959\u20132024, with a near-zero overall budget imbalance, although discrepancies of up to around 1 GtC yr\u22121 persist for the representation of annual to decadal variability in CO2 fluxes. Comparison of estimates from multiple approaches and observations shows: (1) a persistent large uncertainty in the estimate of land-use change emissions, (2) a low agreement between the different methods on the magnitude of the land CO2 flux in the northern extra-tropics, and (3) a discrepancy between the different methods on the mean ocean sink. This living data update documents changes in methods and datasets applied to this most-recent global carbon budget as well as evolving community under"

    "research_summary": "Abstract The South Pacific Meridional Mode (SPMM), a dominant air\u2010sea coupling mode in the subtropical southeastern Pacific, serves as a precursor to equatorial Pacific variability. Its seasonality, however, shows an out\u2010of\u2010phase relation between sea surface temperature (SST) (peaking in December\u2013February, DJF) and wind (peaking in June\u2013August, JJA) indices that remain unclear. Through a mixed\u2010layer heat budget analysis, we reveal that thermodynamical wind\u2010evaporation\u2010SST feedback dominates SPMM\u2010SST growth, with its efficiency controlled by the seasonal cycle of mixed\u2010layer depth, dominating SPMM seasonality. Dynamical processes suppress SPMM\u2010SST anomalies, with meridional advection acting as the dominant damping mechanism in both JJA and DJF, and being particularly strong in JJA. Stronger meridional advection damping in JJA enlarges the DJF peak of SPMM\u2010SST, indicating a role beyond thermodynamics. Further investigation reveals that the meridional advection arises largely from wind stress\u2010driven Ekman transport. These findings highlight the importance of meridional advection process in shaping SPMM seasonality, offering insights for improving SPMM\u2010related climate predictability. Abstract Marine heatwaves (MHWs) are prolonged periods of anomalously high sea surface temperature (SST) that threaten global marine ecosystems, yet their future projections in the Indian Ocean remains poorly understood. Hence, this study systematically evaluates and projects MHWs using 14 Coupled Model Project Intercomparison Phase 6 (CMIP6) models under three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP126, SSP245, SSP585). Results show that raw CMIP6 models tend to overestimate MHW duration and underestimation of intensity due to regional biases, which are substantially reduced through quantile delta mapping bias correction, improving projection accuracy. Bias-corrected projections reveal a sharp increase in MHW intensity and duration by 2100, specifically under SSP585, with SST anomalies exceeding 3 \u00b0C and events lasting over 350 days annually compared to 1985\u20132014. While SSP126 maintains relatively moderate MHW conditions, both SSP245 and SSP585 drive substantial intensification, with SSP585 producing the most severe outcomes. Projected MHWs reveal pronounced seasonality, with lower area coverage during summer monsoon and peaks exposure in late winter and spring. MHW categories undergo a robust shift by 2080, indicating critical ecological and socioeconomic risks. Crucially, the fixed baseline method uncovers that the Arabian Sea and northern Indian Ocean emerge as future MHWs hotspots, transitioning towards near permanent MHWs state as early as 2040\u20132050, revealing an irreversible ecological threat that is otherwise masked by moving-baseline methods. However, the CMIP6 model skill is found to depend more on physical parameterizations than on spatial resolution. Biases in lower-performing models can substantially alter projected MHW occurrence and severity, often projecting the onset of permanent MHW conditions by several decades earlier and challenging the development of policy and mitigation strategies. <title>Abstract</title> Clouds significantly influence Earth\u2019s radiative balance with complex ongoing response to surface warming. Key drivers of change are sea surface temperature (SST) pattern effect that reshapes cloud distributions, and beta feedback that scales low-level fraction change to climatological amounts. Cloud radiative feedback remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate projections, but current constraints are insufficient. Here, we demonstrate that the percentage change in tropical cloud fraction, driven by spatial patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) increase, is linked to cloud height variations. We introduce a proportional warmer-get-higher paradigm and develop a pattern-based analytical framework, identifying three key factors governing cloud feedback: percentage cloud sensitivity to SST, climatological cloud cover, and SST warming patterns relative to the tropical mean. By leveraging recent observations to constrain these factors in two stages, we establish a process-oriented emergent constraint on projected cloud feedback in the 21st century. The first stage substitutes simulated cloud sensitivity and mean cloud cover to correct biases and reduce spread by half. Explaining 62% of remaining spread in an attribution procedure, SST pattern effect is further constrained by the second stage. This percentage framework yields total, low, middle, and high cloud feedback of 0.49 \u00b1 0.27, 0.33 \u00b1 0.21, 0.09 \u00b1 0.09, and 0.07 \u00b1 0.06 W m <sup>\u2212 2</sup> K <sup>\u2212 1</sup> (90% confidence), respectively. It reduces intermodel uncertainty by 59% for cloud feedback and 33% for surface warming, resulting in a climate sensitivity of 4.08 \u00b1 0.97 K. Abstract Marine heatwaves (MHWs) pose significant threats to marine ecosystems and associated services, necessitating a deeper understanding of their driving mechanism. T"

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> The substantial risks posed to Venice and its lagoon by ongoing and projected sea-level rise require unprecedented long-term adaptation strategies. With present insufficient greenhouse gas mitigation policies, the current open lagoon strategy, with mobile barriers and multiple accommodation measures, is likely to encounter hard limits within the current century. Follow-up strategies could be based either on ring-dikes, isolating the city from the rest of the lagoon, or on a closed lagoon with permanent coastal dams separating it from the sea. Relocation of monuments to a suitable inland area and abandonment of Venice would be the only remaining strategy for sea-level above 10-15 m. Indicative adaptation costs increase with sea level rise from less than 1 to more than 30Ge. Abandonment might become unavoidable in the 22nd century under current climate policies and an Antarctic ice-sheet collapse, a risk that could still be avoided by a rapid reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Abstract Mediterranean coastal wetlands account for important biodiversity and ecosystem services. But climate-change induced sea-level rise poses a critical risk to their survival. Here, we assess these risks for Mediterranean coastal marshes, one key type of Mediterranean coastal wetlands, and identify main drivers for future coastal marsh change for the Mediterranean and comparable coastlines. We apply an integrated modelling approach that accounts for future sea-level rise, sediment accretion, coastal management and marsh inland migration processes. Depending on climate mitigation scenarios, widespread coastal marsh loss is projected, ranging from 8% to 92% of current extents. For Egypt, France, and Algeria, we predict (near) total loss of coastal marshes by 2100 for current coastal management and sediment supply scenarios. Overall, losses could at least be halved if additional inland migration space were created, e.g. through passive or active habitat restoration. Bold climate mitigation and local adaptation are needed to preserve existing coastal marshes. <title>Abstract</title> Mediterranean open marine and coastal ecosystems face multiple risks, due to climate change, that impact their unique biodiversity. To assess these risks and evaluate their confidence levels, we adopt the scenario-based approach of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), relying on a review of literature projecting changes in Mediterranean Sea ecosystems. The main drivers of environmental change are sea level rise, ocean warming and acidification. Similar to global conditions, all Mediterranean ecosystems face high risks under all climate scenarios, with coastal ecosystems being more strongly impacted than open marine ecosystems. For these coastal ecosystems, risk levels are expected to become very high already once global warming exceeds 0.8\u00b0C with respect to the 1976\u20132005 period. A few Mediterranean ecosystems (e.g., coralligenous and rocky coasts) have greater adaptive capacity than all others, probably because of the long evolutionary history in this sea and the presence of a variety of climatic and hydrological conditions. Overall, due to the higher observed and projected rates of climate change in the Mediterranean, compared to global trends, for variables such as seawater temperature and pH, marine ecosystems (particularly coastal) are projected to be under higher risks compared to the global ocean."

    "research_summary": "Abstract Unraveling the drivers of climate variability during the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) remains a central challenge in paleoclimate research. This interval marked a shift from 41-kyr to 100-kyr glacial cycles associated with larger ice sheets. While previous studies emphasize interactions between climate and Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, Antarctica\u2019s role remains unclear. We use the Parallel Ice Sheet Model to simulate Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution over the last 3 million years, applying a climate index approach. Our simulations show that between 1.9 and 0.8 Ma, several Antarctic drainage basins underwent structural re-organization at different times, including the formation of a stable marine-based West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). We analyze the drivers of these thresholds and their associated state transitions. Our findings reveal tri-stability in the Thwaites basin and suggest that WAIS thresholds and their complex interactions amplified ~ 100-kyr climate variability before and during the MPT, providing new insights into long-term climate dynamics. Abstract Reconstructing marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) across glacial cycles is critical for understanding the sensitivity of the marine carbon sink to natural climatic change. Published estimates of DIC invoke linear relationships between DIC and , apparent oxygen utilization (AOU), or C. These relationships are based on conceptual models and correlations from modern spatial tracer gradients. However, it remains unclear whether the spatial correlations also hold for temporal change. Here, we apply these empirical methods to Earth system model results to test their applicability to transient glacial\u2010interglacial changes. The model uses established, experimentally\u2010constrained carbonate system solvers and explicitly tracks the various components of the carbon cycle (e.g., DIC, alkalinity, temperature, ). Predicting simulated DIC from simulated , AOU, or C often results in large prediction errors. The interplay of the carbonate system, ocean circulation, and biologically\u2010mediated DIC and alkalinity re\u2010distributions creates a system too complex to be captured by existing empirical methods. Specifically, large local alkalinity changes can arise due to circulation and export production changes even without substantial changes in global mean alkalinity. Consequently, reconstructed constrains DIC changes insufficiently. Similarly, marine AOU or C are not reliable proxies of remineralized DIC. Furthermore, DIC changes are not a direct metric for atmospheric drawdown even without considering changes in global mean alkalinity because of net carbon exchange with sediments and the land biosphere. We suggest that spatially\u2010resolved, transient Earth system simulations may provide a more reliable means of estimating carbon cycle shifts observed in proxy data than current empirical methods. Abstract Interactions between The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) And The Greenland Ice-Sheet (GrIS), both considered major tipping elements in the Earth system, are critical for understanding their future evolution under anthropogenic climate change. As global warming progresses, the potential weakening of the AMOC raises concerns that meltwater from the disintegrating GrIS could trigger a complete AMOC shutdown. Here, we assess the processes and feedback mechanisms that may either accelerate or stabilize these two Earth system components under idealized future scenarios in an ice-sheet coupled Earth system model of intermediate complexity with perturbed parameter ensembles. Our findings indicate that, under a moderate idealized scenario (2\u00d7CO 2 , PI , corresponding to \u223c3 \u00b0C global mean warming), GrIS meltwater alone is unlikely to trigger an AMOC collapse. However, this risk increases with higher emissions. Notably, the delayed GrIS response to the warming results in peak meltwater fluxes entering the North Atlantic only when the AMOC is already in its recovery phase, Thereby reducing the likelihood of collapse. Additionally, the system is further stabilized by the cooling induced by the thermal bipolar seesaw. This cooling is sufficiently strong that, in the event of a future AMOC collapse, GrIS melting would effectively cease for \u223c3 \u00b0C warming, and its disintegration would be substantially delayed even under higher warming levels. Nonetheless, rapid CO 2 reduction remains essential to prevent irreversible state transitions of both the AMOC and GrIS."

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT When designing new protected areas, conservation managers often use bioclimatic models to anticipate the effects of climate change on species distributions. Recent studies have shown that the outputs of such models frequently differ in direction and magnitude, generating uncertainties that compromise their value for guiding conservation plans. Traditional approaches tend to minimise this uncertainty by designing adaptive strategies or by complexifying predictive models. However, these approaches may prove inadequate when uncertainty grows too large, as is the case with climate change. Here, rather than attempting to reduce uncertainty, we propose to embrace and value it in order to seek conservation measures that are as robust as possible to many plausible futures. By adapting this \u201cRobust Decision Making\u201d framework to conservation, we stress tested five generic conservation strategies against hundreds of plausible futures, for each of 22 species of concern. Our conceptual study seeks the strengths and vulnerabilities of each strategy across many possible future directions, facilitating both decision\u2010making amongst strategies and emergence of robust and adaptive conservation plans. We anticipate our approach to offer an innovative framework to complement classic species conservation planning methods by reducing sensitivity to climate change uncertainty and improving the overall performance of conservation actions. Abstract To achieve sustainable targets, international panels call for a transformative change in human\u2013nature interactions to foster human well\u2010being and promote pro\u2010environmental behaviour. The extent to which people considered themselves as part of nature\u2014known as human\u2013nature connectedness\u2014has been shown to be a key societal trait for achieving such a transformative change. Human\u2013nature connectedness is linked to improved human welfare and actions for nature conservation and can be increased by direct contact with natural environments in adults living in the Global North. It has not been shown whether these relations are true across lifetimes and in the Global South, making it difficult to generalise about the effects of human\u2013nature connectedness globally. Here, we conducted a cross\u2010sectional study to examine and compare human\u2013nature connectedness across ages in 1858 participants aged 3\u201387 years from two countries: France ( N = 1059) and Colombia ( N = 799). We also investigated the links between human\u2013nature connectedness, pro\u2010environmental behaviours, well\u2010being and two indicators of opportunity to experience nature (i.e. degree of urbanisation and forest cover around the participants' municipality of residence). Results show that human\u2013nature connectedness is positively related to well\u2010being and pro\u2010environmental behaviours in both countries. Analyses revealed an age\u2010related pattern of human\u2013nature connectedness with a significant decline from childhood to the mid\u2010teens in both countries. Overall, Colombian participants have a higher human\u2013nature connectedness than French participants and individuals' human\u2013nature connectedness was negatively linked to the urbanisation's indices in both countries. Here, we show that human\u2013nature connectedness is linked to sustainable outcomes in a Global South country, just as it is in the Global North. Our study also suggests that increasing contact with nature during formative teenage years could mitigate the observed decline in human\u2013nature connectedness. Future studies are warranted combining qualitative and quantitative measures related to human\u2013nature connectedness, nature experiences, values and practices in relation to nature, in multiple countries from the global South. Our study indicates that enhancing human\u2013nature connectedness could provide an additional tool for achieving sustainable targets globally , not just in highly developed northern\u2010hemisphere countries.

Abstract As plant species expand their upper limits of distribution under current warming, some retain both traditional climate space and biotic environment while others encounter novel conditions. The latter is the case for Rhododendron campanulatum , a woody shrub that grows both above and below treeline at our study site in the Eastern Himalayas where a very conspicuous, stable treeline was defined by a nearly contiguous canopy of tall Abies spectabilis trees, many of which are over a century old. Prior work showed that treeline had remained static in this region while R. campanulatum expanded its elevational range limit. We tested local adaptation of R. campanulatum by performing reciprocal transplants between the species' current elevational range limit (4023 m above sea level [asl]) and just above treeline (3876 m asl). Contrary to expectation, the coldest temperatures of late winter and early mid\u2010spring were experienced by plants at the lower elevation: R. campanulatum at species' limit (upper si"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) remain a major source of climate uncertainty due to missing large-scale observational constraints. Such a constraint, with global cloud representativeness, has recently been developed based on the Holuhraun-2014 volcanic eruption from machine learning with satellite observations. Here, we confront this large-scale observational constraint against six diverse global climate models to advance our understanding of ACI simulation uncertainty. We show that marine liquid cloud optical depth responses to aerosols are reasonably well simulated, although through compensating errors. However, all models largely underestimate cloud cover responses to aerosols, with five of them outside the 90% confidence level. This persistent bias remains despite tuning five distinct cloud schemes and testing various key cloud processes. Such bias in cloud cover response is a major driver of simulation uncertainty in ACI cooling and needs to be addressed urgently to improve climate projections and estimations of climate sensitivity. Abstract. Observational evidence reveals a pronounced wetting trend over Central Asia in recent decades, with the most substantial increases occurring during winter and summer. Yet the extent to which the drivers of these changes differ seasonally remains unknown. Here, we use single-forcing experiments from the Precipitation Driver and Response Model Intercomparison Project (PDRMIP) to examine the effects of various external forcings on winter and summer precipitation across Central Asia and to explore the physical mechanisms underlying seasonal precipitation changes. We find that greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing mainly increases winter precipitation by enhancing atmospheric moisture content through warming. In contrast, in summer, Asian sulfate aerosols enhance precipitation by modulating the westerly jet, which strengthens atmospheric moisture transport into the region. Asian black carbon exerts an opposing influence that partially offsets the sulfate-induced effect. Further attribution analysis based on CMIP6 simulations reinforces these sensitivity results that GHG forcing is the primary driver of winter precipitation increases whereas anthropogenic aerosols dominate summer trends. Future CMIP6 projections suggest that under moderate- to high-emission scenarios, winter precipitation will continue to rise due to increasing GHG concentrations, while summer precipitation may decline across much of Central Asia as a result of reduced aerosol emissions following Asian clean air policies. These findings highlight a distinct seasonality in the drivers of recent precipitation increase and suggest a plausible divergence in future winter and summer precipitation trends. Abstract. Understanding the global hydrogen (H\u2082) budget is critical as H2 is expected to play an important role in future energy systems. Tropospheric H2 sources include direct emissions and atmospheric production via chemical reactions, while sinks are soil uptake and removal by hydroxyl radical (OH). Large uncertainties remain in quantifying the atmospheric production and loss of H2 largely due to the lack of global-scale knowledge of the abundance of OH. We use a suite of global three-dimensional Atmospheric Chemistry Models to evaluate key reactive species involved in atmospheric production and loss \u2013 formaldehyde (HCHO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and carbon monoxide (CO) \u2013 with satellite retrievals. A box model is then used to simulate the evolution of global mean tropospheric H2 from pre-industrial to present day; to test different relative contributions in atmospheric production from methane and Volatile Organic Compounds; and to assess atmospheric loss with different OH concentrations. Isotopic compositions are further used to constrain these sources and sink terms and assess the possibility of geological sources. Models generally match satellite retrievals for HCHO, though model diversity exists for NO2 and CO. From model evaluations and box model constraints, we estimate atmospheric H2 production of 37\u201360 Tg/year, and atmospheric losses of 15\u201330 Tg/year, suggesting that some top-down literature estimates may overestimate production. Box model results suggest an upper bound 9 Tg/year for geological sources, considerably lower than the 23 Tg/yr proposed previously. We recommend more isotopic observations and targeted measurement campaigns to further refine the budget."

    "research_summary": "Agricultural intensification in grasslands, characterized by increased livestock density, frequent mowing, and landscape homogenization, has driven significant declines in insect populations. Butterflies, key indicators of habitat quality, are sensitive to intensification and often used for monitoring. As they are influenced by the landscape context, understanding the landscapes surrounding monitoring transects is crucial for the evaluation of the status of butterflies and the effectiveness of conservation strategies. Using data from the German Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (DEBMS), we applied a nested clustering approach to group landscapes surrounding survey transects by dominant land cover, land-use intensity, and landscape structure. We then related these landscape contexts to butterfly diversity and community composition. Grassland- and forest-dominated clusters had highest species richness, abundance, number of specialists, and endangered species, while urban clusters had the lowest. Most species occurred independently of dominant land-cover types, highlighting the importance of even small proportions of habitats to support populations. We found no statistically significant differences in butterfly communities within crop- and grassland-dominated clusters when comparing different land-use intensity and landscape structure characteristics. However, data indicated higher richness, abundance, and more endangered species on less intensively managed grasslands. Our findings underscore the value of citizen science monitoring schemes in capturing broad-scale patterns in land use and landscape structure. Although clusters did not strongly differentiate distinct butterfly communities, they suggest that maintaining less intensively managed grasslands and expanding semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes can enhance butterfly diversity. We highlight the importance of accounting for landscape contexts when interpreting biodiversity patterns and informing conservation strategies. In order to truly look ahead and address pressing biodiversity challenges, the GBF needs a new international program that coordinates biodiversity research and modeling. We label this initiative the World Biodiversity Research Programme. Abstract Smart biodiversity indicators are needed not only for assessing and managing biodiversity (change) but also for informing target setting for environmental policies. This need has created a plethora of indicator frameworks, which are widely debated in terms of their design and usefulness. We propose that these discussions would benefit from more clearly separating different types of indicators and more operationally linking them to management targets and biodiversity goals. Decision makers often consider the multitude of biodiversity indicators as being complicated , whereas scientists emphasize that they barely reflect how complex biodiversity is. It is therefore important to differentiate clearly between indicators for diagnosing (the drivers of) biodiversity change and indicators for steering policies. While the former must be scalable in time and space and reflect the full complexity of biodiversity, the latter need long\u2010term visions and simplicity. Management targets such as proportions of protected areas or mitigation of biodiversity drivers have the advantage of being operation\u2010oriented, well quantifiable and immediately responsive to change. Achieving a management target, however, does not necessarily equal achieving a biodiversity goal. Likewise, management indicators that track how well management targets are achieved cannot replace diagnostic or steering indicators. Solution: Biodiversity goals such as \u2018bending the curve\u2019 can only be achieved by closely linking diagnosis, steering and management, while accepting that their distinct design principles need to be addressed. Being aware and accepting such tailored types of different indicators and management targets could strongly improve the interplay between science and policy to reverse negative biodiversity trends in the future. Ongoing global change is leading to the widespread redistribution of species1,2. Assessments of shifts in species geographic ranges, however, remain taxonomically biased and geographically limited2, especially for insects. We conducted a global synthesis on butterfly range shifts using a combination of multi-lingual review in 15 languages and expert assessments, compiling data on range shifts for 1758 species (10% of described butterfly species) from 109 countries over the last three decades. In 5 of these countries, over 50% of butterfly species shifted their ranges. Overall, most species showed horizontal range expansion (81%), while 27% contracted their range and 22% shifted in elevation. Expansions were primarily reported in tropical species-rich regions, while 19% of species displayed multiple, concurrent range shifts in different countries, highlighting the complexity of these responses.

    "research_summary": "Sous-vide cooking has attracted considerable attention for its capacity to minimise nutritional and qualitative degradation in muscle foods, with research into the intricate changes in sensory attributes becoming a particular focal point. This paper presents recent insights into the sensory transformations of meat, especially shifts in texture, color, and flavour during sous-vide processing. Both cooking temperature and duration exert important influences, with temperature generally playing a more pivotal role across diverse conditions. The molecular mechanisms underlying the impacts of sous-vide cooking on muscle foods are comprehensively delineated. Notably, partial protein denaturation is a critical factor influencing textural changes. Compared with conventional thermal cooking, certain endogenous enzyme activities are retained during sous-vide processing. Furthermore, alterations in protein structure affecting water migration are crucial for meat juiciness. Flavour development is closely linked to lipid oxidation and its interplay with amino acids. To advance understanding in this domain, the application of mass spectrometry, omics, and other advanced analytical techniques is deemed imperative. This review provides comprehensive insights into the sensory and molecular changes occurring in meat during sous-vide cooking, which offer valuable guidance for researchers and industries to understand the underlying mechanisms and optimise culinary techniques in this domain. ABSTRACT As global climate change intensifies, compound extremes (CEs) have become more frequent and have increased the vulnerability of terrestrial vegetation. While future climate change is expected to continue to exacerbate the severity of CEs, there remains a significant gap in understanding the relative contribution of different CEs to vegetation damage. In other words, there is an urgent need to identify the dominant CE inhibiting vegetation growth. In this study, we focused on six major CE categories over China and examined their spatiotemporal distribution during 2001\u20132018. We then utilised satellite\u2010derived vegetation index to detect negative extremes of vegetation growth (NEVs) induced by CEs. By quantifying the coincidence rate of CEs with NEVs, we revealed compound dry extremes as the dominant CE event with the highest coincidence with NEVs in 37% vegetated area in China, followed by compound dry\u2010cold extremes (22%). Generally, dry extremes were more likely to pose vegetation damage than wet extremes and climate warming has exacerbated these negative effects. In particular, grassland was more susceptible to compound droughts than shrubland/forest because of its lower resistance to environmental stress. Our findings will enhance the current understanding of CE impacts and serve as a guide for developing long\u2010term strategies to mitigate CE risks under climate change. Abstract Northeast China (NEC) is one of the major crop producing regions in China, which is severely affected by persistently extreme temperatures during summer. Previous works focused on understanding the intensity of extreme temperatures, yet neglecting its duration and timing. Considering the critical role of 25\u201360\u2010day intraseasonal variability (ISV) in inducing persistent temperature anomalies, our investigation found that 25\u201360\u2010day ISVs over both subtropical jet (SJ) and polar front jet (PJ) regions regulate the NEC temperature via the modulation of humidity and related longwave radiation (LR). During positive (negative) phase of PJ ISV, advection of climatological potential vorticity by strong meridional winds within the cyclonic\u2010anticyclonic (anticyclonic\u2010cyclonic) circulation favors the wave train corresponding to negative (positive) phase of SJ ISV. This interaction further amplifies and prolongs the impacts of SJ and PJ ISVs nonlinearly, with temperature decreases during the configuration of positive SJ and negative PJ ISV becoming 83% larger, and 6 days longer. Abstract. In a rapidly changing climate, evidence-based decision-making benefits from up-to-date and timely information. Here we compile monitoring datasets (published at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15639576; Smith et al., 2025a) to produce updated estimates for key indicators of the state of the climate system: net emissions of greenhouse gases and short-lived climate forcers, greenhouse gas concentrations, radiative forcing, the Earth's energy imbalance, surface temperature changes, warming attributed to human activities, the remaining carbon budget, and estimates of global temperature extremes. This year, we additionally include indicators for sea-level rise and land precipitation change. We follow methods as closely as possible to those used in the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group One report. The indicators show that human activities are increasing the Earth's energy imbalance and driving faster sea-level rise compared to the AR6 assessment. For the 2015\u20132024 decade average, ob"

    "research_summary": "According to the introduction, this Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups (WGs) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). It discusses the observations of climate change, causes and effects, options for adaptation and mitigation, and remaining uncertainties. Land use change is crucial to addressing the existential threats of climate change and biodiversity loss while enhancing food security [M. Zurek et al. , Science 376 , 1416\u20131421 (2022)]. The interconnected and spatially varying nature of the impacts of land use change means that these challenges must be addressed simultaneously [H.-O. P\u00f6rtner et al. , Science 380 , eabl4881 (2023)]. However, governments commonly focus on single issues, incentivizing land use change via \u201cFlat-Rate\u201d subsidies offering constant per hectare payments, uptake of which is determined by the economic circumstances of landowners rather than the integrated environmental outcomes that will be delivered [G. Q. Bull et al. , Forest Policy Econ. 9 , 13\u201331 (2006)]. Here, we compare Flat-Rate subsidies to two alternatives: \u201cLand Use Scenario\u201d allocation of subsidies through consultation across stakeholders and interested parties; and a \u201cNatural Capital\u201d approach which targets subsidies according to expected ecosystem service response. This comparison is achieved by developing a comprehensive decision support system, integrating new and existing natural, physical, and economic science models to quantify environmental, agricultural, and economic outcomes. Applying this system to the United Kingdom\u2019s net zero commitment to increase carbon storage via afforestation, we show that the three approaches result in significantly different outcomes in terms of where planting occurs, their environmental consequences, and economic costs and benefits. The Flat-Rate approach actually increases net carbon emissions while Land Use Scenario allocation yields poor economic outcomes. The Natural Capital targeted approach outperforms both alternatives, providing the highest possible social values while satisfying net zero commitments."

    "research_summary": "Reliable estimates of storm surge and sea level extremes with proper uncertainty quantification are key for cost-effective risk/adaptation planning. However, observational estimates are often unavailable or uncertain along most coastlines owing to data scarcity. Here, we provide a fully observational-driven probabilistic dataset (US-CoastEX) of storm surge and sea level extremes for the U.S. coast (1950-2020). Non-stationary extreme storm surge distributions are generated for gauged and ungauged sites by applying Bayesian methods to the U.S. tide gauge network, complemented with additional storm data unavailable in commonly used tide gauge data. The distributions are combined with tidal peak data to estimate return periods and levels of extreme sea levels and their uncertainty. Ou results show that traditional site-by-site estimates based on existing model data, as well as regionally-aggregated analysis of standard tide gauge data, have underestimated 100-year extreme sea levels by 50% (on average) along much of the U.S. coast, especially in regions exposed to extreme storms. The data supports coastal managers to make decisions, especially in vulnerable areas where in-situ sea-level monitoring is limited. The combination of global warming and urban heat islands (UHI) leads to a range of socio-economic problems, including labor productivity reduction, health burdens, and increased energy demand. While heat mitigation strategies can substantially alleviate local heat stress, practical climate mitigation policies require a careful evaluation of the benefits and costs of different heat mitigation solutions. The baseline cost of UHI without intervention is of critical importance since it serves as a reference for comparing different mitigation options and informs the unquantified economic losses that cities endure due to their UHIs. Previous economic studies have focused on the economic effects of climate change and greenhouse gas mitigations, yet a quantitative assessment of this baseline cost of UHI remains lacking due to an almost universal lack of urban representation in climate datasets. This gap limits policymakers\u2019 ability to develop economically rational action plans to reduce urban heat stress.This study aims to: (1) quantify the economic implications of UHI in the contiguous United States, and (2) perform a cost-benefit analysis of various mitigation strategies to develop cost-efficient heat mitigation portfolios. Using high-resolution climate data with urban climate representation and sectoral impact models, we have quantified the UHI-induced additional mortality rate, energy consumption, and labor loss. By incorporating monetization methods in econometric models, our preliminary assessment shows that UHI significantly amplifies the economic costs associated with regional heat stress. Our ongoing analyses aim to estimate the cost of implementing various urban adaptation strategies, including urban green, radiative cooling, and blue infrastructure, and provide a cost-benefit assessment to guide policymakers in designing effective urban climate adaptation plans. Abstract Increasing climate risks introduce new sources of uncertainty to smallholder farmers\u2019 livelihood decisions. While farmers in different development contexts tend to accurately perceive long-term climatic trends, livelihood diversification as a climate resilience strategy has generally lagged behind awareness of climate risks. In this study, we investigate potential mechanisms behind this lagged response through a survey of 500 farming households in Nepal\u2019s Chitwan Valley, a region that is highly dependent on subsistence agriculture and highly exposed to several climate-driven hazards. Specifically, we employ a suite of cross-sectional and time series econometric techniques to analyze how farmers\u2019 information sources, social capital, and previous exposure to climate hazards shape climate risk perceptions and livelihood decisions. We find that climate-driven risks are highly salient to household perceptions of farming risks; however, they also drive higher perceived risks of common livelihood diversification strategies, including rural\u2013urban migration and off-farm employment. Further, while farming households generally maintain diversified income portfolios, exposure to droughts and/or floods leads to persistent increases in the reliance on farming income, which we term a \u201cretrenchment\u201d response. We find evidence for both financial and psychological mechanisms behind this response, which may exacerbate environmentally driven poverty traps. Our results indicate that efforts to build farmers\u2019 resilience to climate risks should especially account for perceived risks of livelihood alternatives, financial constraints, and loss-averse behavior in response to income shocks."

    "research_summary": "Abstract We present Bedmap3, the latest suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of the Antarctic south of 60 \u00b0S. Bedmap3 incorporates and adds to all post-1950s datasets previously used for Bedmap2, including 84 new aero-geophysical surveys by 15 data providers, an additional 52 million data points and 1.9 million line-kilometres of measurement. These efforts have filled notable gaps including in major mountain ranges and the deep interior of East Antarctica, along West Antarctic coastlines and on the Antarctic Peninsula. Our new Bedmap3/RINGS grounding line similarly consolidates multiple recent mappings into a single, spatially coherent feature. Combined with updated maps of surface topography, ice shelf thickness, rock outcrops and bathymetry, Bedmap3 reveals in much greater detail the subglacial landscape and distribution of Antarctica\u2019s ice, providing new opportunities to interpret continental-scale landscape evolution and to model the past and future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheets. Abstract Electrification has proven to be an effective way to lower operational costs and reduce the carbon footprint of drilling operations. This paper provides a technical analysis of highline (grid) power utilization on drilling rigs through the lens of an innovative technology that connects a rig to a power grid, reducing Scope One emissions to nearly zero. Traditionally, diesel engines and generators have been used to produce electricity, both direct and alternating current (DC and AC) for drilling operations. This power source is effective and reliable, but it has drawbacks that can be addressed using highline electrical power, which is more affordable, efficient, and clean. Recently introduced technology allows drilling operations to be powered by an electrical utility grid using a substation transformer to step down highline power voltages to rig voltage and interface the utility grid with the rig's powerhouse. An electrical transfer switch enables the rig to switch between highline and generator power quickly and easily. In situations where grid power cannot be utilized, the highline transformer module allows the existing power generation system to remain integrated to the drilling rig. The system is compatible with both Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) and Silicon Controlled Rectifier (SCR) drilling rigs and has minimal impact on rig move timelines. Powering the drilling rig with electricity instead of generators decreases on-location emissions and noise levels to near zero, and highline power can reduce the overall carbon footprint of drilling operations even more when utility power is created by more efficient and lower polluting methods such as natural gas power plants, nuclear power, or renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.). Field data collected from more than 20 highline transformer modules deployed on rigs across the Lower 48 United States demonstrates an average daily reduction in Scope One emissions of 20 metric tons of CO2e per rig. With highline powered operations becoming more commonplace in the United States, technological advancements are starting to make their way to global markets. Accurate quantification of iceberg populations is essential to inform estimates of Southern Ocean freshwater&#13;\\nand heat balances as well as shipping hazards. The automated operational monitoring of icebergs remains&#13;\\nchallenging, largely due to a lack of generality in existing approaches. Previous efforts to map icebergs have&#13;\\noften exploited synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data but the majority are designed for open water situations,&#13;\\nrequire significant operator input, and are susceptible to the substantial spatial and temporal variability in&#13;\\nbackscatter that characterises SAR time-series. We propose an adaptive unsupervised classification procedure&#13;\\nbased on Sentinel 1 SAR data and a recursive Dirichlet Process implementation of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture&#13;\\nModel. The approach is robust to inter-scene variability and can identify icebergs even within complex&#13;\\nenvironments containing mixtures of open water, sea ice and icebergs of various sizes. For the study area&#13;\\nin the Amundsen Sea Embayment, close to the calving front of Thwaites Glacier, our classifier achieved a&#13;\\nmean pixel-wise F1 score against manual iceberg delineations from the SAR scenes of 0.960 \u00b1 0.018 with a&#13;\\ncorresponding object-level F1 score of 0.729 \u00b1 0.086. The method provides an excellent basis for estimation of&#13;\\ntotal near-shore iceberg populations and has inherent potential for scalability that other approaches lack. Abstract. One of the key components of this research has been the mapping of Antarctic bed topography and ice thickness parameters that are crucial for modelling ice flow and hence for predicting future ice loss and the ensuing sea level rise.

    "research_summary": "Cuando la deserci\u00f3n es producto de la ruptura de la conexi\u00f3n de intereses que unen a un estudiante con una instituci\u00f3n educativa o por la ausencia de pol\u00edticas que favorezcan la permanencia de estudiantes en las instituciones, el costo econ\u00f3mico y social de una deserci\u00f3n es mayor porque se deteriora la calidad de vida del estudiante y por ende afecta el crecimiento de un pa\u00eds, m\u00e1s cuando la educaci\u00f3n es considerada como un factor esencial en el crecimiento econ\u00f3mico y la reducci\u00f3n de la pobreza. El proyecto analiza el fen\u00f3meno de la deserci\u00f3n en el Centro de Servicios Empresariales y Tur\u00edsticos del SENA Regional Santander CSET, teniendo en cuenta que esta regional se ubica en cuarto lugar entre las 33 regionales del pa\u00eds por los altos niveles de deserci\u00f3n que presenta en los \u00faltimos periodos, con \u00edndices de deserci\u00f3n por encima del promedio nacional. De igual manera motivaron el presente estudio, el procedimiento no estandarizado para registrar novedades a la matr\u00edcula, el desconocimiento de las causas que inciden en la deserci\u00f3n y el an\u00e1lisis de indicadores que muestran incremento en las cifras; al leer estas situaciones con una mirada hol\u00edstica, se visualiz\u00f3 el problema sobre la ausencia de estrategias efectivas, direccionadas por una pol\u00edtica unificada para la gesti\u00f3n del fen\u00f3meno de la deserci\u00f3n que contrarreste los efectos generados por estas causas. Con el desarrollo de este proyecto se presenta la oportunidad para reorientar una pol\u00edtica integral para el CSET y porque no, todos los centros de formaci\u00f3n con el objetivo de fidelizar al aprendiz y un manejo efectivo de los \u00edndices de retenci\u00f3n. Con el fin de obtener resultados en los objetivos planteados, el estudio se estructur\u00f3 en dos fases con un enfoque de Investigaci\u00f3n mixta, de car\u00e1cter no experimental de corte transversal. En el dise\u00f1o de la estrategia se bas\u00f3 en la metodolog\u00eda del marco l\u00f3gico por su alta exigencia de participaci\u00f3n interactiva de los interesados durante todas sus fases. &#13;\\nLa primera etapa corresponde a la fase de diagn\u00f3stico que incluye los tres primeros objetivos, iniciando con el ejercicio de retrospectiva de los casos de deserci\u00f3n del per\u00edodo 2015-2018, mediante t\u00e9cnicas de estad\u00edstica descriptiva, estos datos se analizaron para conocer las causas que motivaron la deserci\u00f3n de aprendices en ese per\u00edodo; la informaci\u00f3n de las caracter\u00edsticas socioecon\u00f3micas de los aprendices activos en formaci\u00f3n y los factores que inciden en la deserci\u00f3n de aprendices, se correlacionaron usando el software de an\u00e1lisis cuantitativo IBM SPSS . En la segunda etapa los resultados del diagn\u00f3stico son utilizados para contextualizar y sensibilizar a los participantes de un grupo focal con 15 funcionarios de diferentes niveles de la entidad, propuesto para recoger experiencias y conceptos, frente a una serie de preguntas relacionadas con aspectos pedag\u00f3gicos e institucionales que impactan el fen\u00f3meno de deserci\u00f3n. La informaci\u00f3n obtenida se agrup\u00f3 y analiz\u00f3 con el apoyo del software Atlas ti, para determinar los elementos estrat\u00e9gicos que fueron el insumo principal en la construcci\u00f3n de la estrategia. A partir de los hallazgos encontrados fue posible el dise\u00f1o de la estrategia de gesti\u00f3n para disminuir la deserci\u00f3n de aprendices del CSET, que motive su permanencia hasta garantizar que culmine el ciclo de formaci\u00f3n, certificaci\u00f3n y futura vinculaci\u00f3n laboral."

    "research_summary": "Convective downdrafts are a crucial part of convective systems and can cause local damage by generating severe surface gusts. However, fully representing the mechanisms behind strong downdrafts and gusts in models remains difficult. We conducted short-duration regional simulations using a nested downscaling approach with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model including a cloud-resolving innermost subregion at various grid spacings down to 200-m. The model generated a strong gust event characterized by a pronounced, coherent downdraft that we used to study the forcing mechanisms. The 1-km simulation underestimated the downdraft and 5-km didn\u2019t represent it at all. In addition, the 1-km simulated weaker downdrafts exhibited a vertical momentum budget different to that of the 200-m simulation. The perturbation pressure vertical gradient and thermal buoyancy are the main contributors to the downdraft acceleration in the 200-m simulation, with condensate loading playing a less significant role than other processes at mid and low levels. Coarser resolutions underestimate the role of perturbation pressure, resulting in a smaller contribution to downward acceleration compared to thermal buoyancy and condensate loading. This highlights the potential importance of the spatial distribution of downdraft forcing mechanisms as a key consideration for why coarser grid spacings may fail to adequately capture more realistic downdrafts. The findings presented here are relevant for risk assessment applications and parameterizations of downdrafts, demonstrating benefits of large-eddy simulations (LES) for wind hazard analysis and highlighting the need for care when interpreting results from coarser models. Abstract This study employs the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) to investigate the independent influences of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) on Australian springtime rainfall and temperature variability. A pacemaker-style experiment was conducted using a variable-resolution configuration with ~20 km resolution over Australia. Three 10-member ensemble simulations were performed: a control run (CTRL), a noENSO run with tropical Pacific ENSO-driven sea surface temperature (SST) variability removed via Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) filtering, and a noIOD run with IOD-related SST variability removed. The results demonstrate that ENSO is the primary driver of Australian rainfall and temperature variability, dominating patterns traditionally linked to both ENSO and IOD. In the noENSO experiment, correlations between climate variables and ENSO/IOD indices are significantly reduced, while in noIOD, the correlations are only slightly weakened. This underscores the limited role of IOD in the CTRL simulation interannual variability. Circulation analysis reveals that removing ENSO-associated SST variability over the tropical Pacific also eliminates circulation responses beyond the tropical Pacific, confirming that ENSO primarily affects Australian climate variability via teleconnections. Additionally, the sensitivity of rainfall correlations to internal variability highlights the importance of ensemble experiments for robustly assessing ENSO/IOD impacts on regional climate dynamics. However, uncertainties remain regarding the interaction between Eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD events, warranting further investigation. Local thunderstorms are among the major meteorological hazards in the Australian region. These storms inherently have compound impacts, including hail, flash floods, and wind gusts, and consistently cause some of the highest insured losses. Studies on the climate change impact on local storms face the challenges of unreliable storm climatology and uncertainties in the numerical modeling of physical processes. In this study we have adopted an approach to examining the ingredients of severe storm development based on regional climate simulations. We examined two generations of NARCliM datasets (NSW and Australian Regional Climate Modeling). Projected changes in convective indices for the latter half of the twenty-first century indicate an environment more conducive to thunderstorm development, primarily due to enhanced atmospheric instability, despite a concurrent increase in convective inhibition. A measure that combines the dynamic factor of vertical wind shear further shows that the potential storm days will increase substantially, such as a doubling of days with storms during summer, under the influence of climate change over tropical, eastern, and southeastern Australia. The storm season in a year is also expected to elongate. These projections imply increasing thunderstorm-related hazards in the future, including hail, flood, and high winds."

    "research_summary": "Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy, and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration driving machine learning model development and deployment. Abstract Extratropical cyclones occasionally escalate into devastating windstorms in Western Europe, causing damages worth billions of euros. However, their response to anthropogenic climate change remains uncertain, primarily due to limitations of coarse\u2010resolution models. This study adopts a high\u2010resolution, event\u2010based approach to examine how climate change may enhance Cyclone Anatol (December 1999), using the 2 km HARMONIE\u2010AROME model within a Pseudo Global Warming (PGW) framework. Results reveal that elevated temperatures amplify wind extremes, both in magnitude and spatial extent, over Denmark and the North Sea, which are linked to increased latent heat release which drives mesoscale instabilities. The findings highlight the potential for even more destructive windstorms in future climates, emphasizing the importance of high\u2010resolution modeling for understanding these dynamics. While this study does not address changes in cyclone frequency, it underscores the heightened risk of extreme windstorms in a warming world and their implications for disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies. Abstract. The global climate is undergoing significant changes, with rising greenhouse gas concentrations driving increased temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and sea level rise. Yet, the full implications for mid-latitude storm systems remain an area of active investigation. This study examines how such storms may intensify under future warming, focusing on Storm Anatol, which severely impacted Denmark on 3 December 1999. Using the high-resolution weather prediction model HARMONIE-AROME and a pseudo-global warming (PGW) framework, the storm is simulated under a range of thermodynamic conditions representative of a warmer climate. Results show a clear warming signal, with increased near-surface temperatures and atmospheric moisture contributing to stronger storm dynamics. Wind and gust speeds rise systematically with temperature, while the spatial extent and duration of damaging wind conditions also expand. To quantify these changes, we introduce the Cumulative Wind Exposure Index (CWEI), which captures the integrated spatial and temporal severity of wind exposure. Application of CWEI reveals a marked increase in cumulative wind exposure in warmer scenarios relative to the historical case. When linked to established wind-damage relationships, this translates to substantially higher potential for structural damage and disruption. These findings suggest that storms like Anatol, already destructive in the past, are likely to become even more damaging under future climate conditions. This underscores the need for climate-resilient building standards, improved early warning systems, and long-term adaptation strategies across northern Europe. Focusing on the Sino-European cities (Copenhagen, Paris and Hangzhou), this project aims to provide tools and case studies for optimizing multimodal traffic management, improving urban mobility, reducing traffic emissions, and finding new solutions towards greener mobility practices, climate-neutral and smart cities.Based on big data, smart traffic management technologies, and integrated interdisciplinary methods, this project will build an Integrated Urban System (IUS) and key performance indicators for each city. With evolving urban planning, energy consumption, transport supply and demand, and group behaviours, the system will improve our understanding of interactions among urban multimodal mobility (e.g. combination of biking and trains), traffic emissions (e.g. switch to electric vehicles), air quality and climate change, and quantify these"

    "research_summary": "The chapter explores the origins of climate change adaptation as a research discipline and as an issue for public policy more broadly. The chapter seeks to articulate the linkages delineations between adaptation and other policy areas. For example, where does adaptation policy end and where does development and/or disaster risk management begin? Are there limitations associated with framing adaptation in the context of development? The chapter also assesses whether adaptation is occurring, and if so why, where and in what form (that is, differences between coping and adapting as well as between autonomous and planned adaptation). This annex describes material prepared to support Chapter 3 of the Adaptation Gap Report 2018 (hereafter ARG2018). It takes up the question of whether there are feasible and robust indicators, based on the aggregation of national data, for measuring collective progress to achieve adaptation goals over periods consistent with the Paris Agreement five year stocktakes. It was prepared by Ian Noble who should be contacted for further information."

    "research_summary": "Due to the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas and aerosol forcing, the Mediterranean has been labeled a \u201cclimate change hot spot.\u201d Previous studies have shown that climate change has dire consequences on socioeconomic situations in the Mediterranean region. Ten high-resolution global coupled climate models and two climate emissions scenarios are analyzed from the Bias Correction Constructed Analogs with Quantile mapping reordering dataset, which is downscaled CMIP6 data. Daily precipitation and air-temperature data from both the wet and dry season is used to calculate droughts and heatwaves in the Mediterranean region, including the Middle East and North Africa countries. As expected, larger impacts are observed in the high emissions scenario and during the dry season for both droughts and heatwaves. Comparing the wet season to the dry season droughts, there is a northward shift in the positive signal as most of the values are seen over the Mediterranean Sea in the wet season and over the northern Mediterranean and Europe in the dry season. For the heatwaves, the dry season shows a response stronger than the one observed by the wet season by nearly two times, and there is a strong signal located over the Mediterranean Sea during the dry season that is not seen during the wet season. Abstract Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow filaments of high water vapor content that have considerable influence on the western United States (US) hydroclimate. ARs provide significant amounts of annual precipitation and snowfall and affect mountain snowpack via snow water equivalent (SWE) accumulation and ablation. With ARs projected to become increasingly key players in western US hydrology, water resource managers will rely progressively more on AR seasonal forecasts to infer flood/drought risks and make informed decisions about water supply allocation. However, precisely how well current seasonal climate prediction systems capture ARs and their associated hydrologic variables is still an open question. Here, we evaluate the ability of high (HR) and low resolution (LR) CCSM4 and CESM1 seasonal global retrospective forecasts to characterize precipitation, snowfall, and SWE changes associated with western US landfalling ARs. HR forecasts more accurately represent hydrologic variables than LR forecasts, however, CCSM4-HR underestimates AR-related snowfall, causing enhanced AR-related SWE ablation. Further investigation reveals amplified onshore positive temperature advection by south-southwesterly biased AR winds causes ARs in CCSM4-HR to be embedded within thicker air columns, yielding increased freezing level heights, reduced snowfall, and increased SWE loss. Results suggest both HR and LR global seasonal forecast models are capable of characterizing AR distribution and frequency, but HR models are needed for proper precipitation, snowfall, and SWE representation. Furthermore, models used to assess AR-related hydrological processes must contain accurate wind fields, as even minor biases can have a profound effect on a model\u2019s ability to simulate AR precipitation and SWE accumulation/ablation rates. Abstract This study investigates the seasonal prediction capabilities of three models, all developed by the National Science Foundation (NSF) National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and implemented by the University of Miami, within the North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) framework. All three models, Community Climate System Model, version 3 (CCSM3), CCSM4, and Community Earth System Model, version 1 (CESM1), are initialized using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) and have a common period of 1991\u20132018. The models\u2019 performance in predicting key climate variables including surface temperature, precipitation, and El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnections is assessed. The models\u2019 prediction skill is assessed using the sign test, a robust nonparametric method for comparing forecast errors. CCSM4 succeeded CCSM3 in 2014, bringing a much more accurate representation of global temperature trends and improved prediction of precipitation extremes and 2-m temperature over land. CESM1, introduced in 2023, shows further improvement relative to CCSM4 in the prediction of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific and precipitation extremes over land. The improvement in precipitation prediction skill is encouraging, as this field has seen little improvement over the life of the NMME. The modeled similarity to observed ENSO teleconnection patterns of 2-m temperature is somewhat less in CESM1 than in CCSM4, although precipitation teleconnection patterns are similar. CCSM4 and CESM1 show stronger surface temperature trends in the tropical Pacific and Southern Ocean than observed trends over the same period, a common problem for current state-of-the-art climate models with implications for prediction and for climate projections.

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT Despite increasing availability of satellite\u2010derived products, in situ glacier observations are pivotal to accurately monitor glacier change and to calibrate and validate glacier models. However, comprehensive multi\u2010variable field observations are especially rare on large glaciers and on debris\u2010covered glaciers. Here we present extensive field observations from Kennicott Glacier, a heavily debris\u2010covered glacier in central Alaska covering more than 400 km 2 . The multi\u2010year data set includes point glacier mass balances, meteorological data from several weather stations on and off the glacier, debris thickness and temperature, ice cliff back wasting derived from time\u2010lapse photography of horizontal stakes drilled into several cliffs, and bathymetry, water temperature, and water level of proglacial and supraglacial lakes. Cumulated summer melt of more than 8 m was observed at the lowest clean\u2010ice sites. Melt rates over clean ice correlate well with elevation, while the rates over debris\u2010covered ice lack any strong elevation dependence. Melt rates drop exponentially with increasing debris thickness and tend to be much lower than for clean ice at similar elevations. Melt rates determined for ice cliffs in areas of otherwise continuous debris cover were up to 10\u00d7 those for debris\u2010covered ice, and even exceeded standard clean ice melt rates. Debris\u2010cover thickness measurements at 150 sites vary from &lt; 1 to 69 cm with an average of 17 \u00b1 11 cm (\u00b1standard deviation). Debris thickens down\u2010glacier, but with high spatial variability\u2013thickness was observed to vary by tens of cm within a ~15 m radius. Depth\u2010averaged thermal heat conductivity derived from supraglacial debris temperature profiles at 12 sites ranges from 0.53 to 1.86 W m \u22121 K \u22121 . Interconnected proglacial lakes covered 1.61 km 2 in 2018 with observed water depths of more than 60 m in the two largest lakes.

Fossil-fuel burning is heating the planet with catastrophic consequences for its habitability and for the natural world on which our existence depends. Halting global warming requires rapid and deep decarbonization to \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, which needs to be achieved by 2050 if warming is to remain within the limits set out by the 2015 Paris Agreement. However, some scientists and engineers claim that a mid-century decarbonization target will not be reached, and they propose that we should focus on technological geoengineering \u201cfixes\u201d or \u201cclimate interventions\u201d that could delay or mask some of the impacts of global warming. They often cite the need to slow warming in polar regions because they are experiencing rates of warming higher than the global average, with severe and irreversible projected consequences both locally (e.g., on fragile ecosystems) and globally (e.g., on sea level). Several geoengineering concepts exist for polar regions, but they have not been fully examined by the polar science community, nor integrated with an understanding of polar dynamics and responses. Here, we evaluate five of those polar geoengineering concepts and highlight the significant issues and risks relating to technological availability, logistical feasibility, cost, predictable adverse consequences, environmental damage, scalability (in space and time), governance, and ethics. According to our expert assessment, none of these geoengineering ideas pass scrutiny regarding their use in the coming decades. Instead, we find that the proposed concepts would be environmentally dangerous. It is clear to us that the assessed approaches are not feasible, and that further research into these techniques would not be an effective use of limited time and resources. It is vital that these ideas do not distract from the priority to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or from the critical need to conduct fundamental research in the polar regions. Introduction The goal of this study is to decompose the influence of specific hydrologic reservoirs in the Earth\u2019s critical zone that interact to create observed total water supply (TWS) anomalies in the highly altered and densely populated Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra drainage basins. Understanding the contributions to TWS anomalies can help find potential solutions for the sustainability of human water supply. Methods We compare changes in the macroscale hydrology of three important High Mountain Asian drainage basins through seasonal and long-term trends in TWS. Statistical time-series analysis of nine individual TWS components modeled by a hydrologic model are used to simulate water storage terms. Results Long-term TWS trends look similar across the study basins, we find that the drivers and causes of trends and their seasonal variability are fundamentally different in each basin. TWS declines in the Indus and Gang"

    "research_summary": "Abstract In an interconnected world, climate change impacts can cascade across sectors and regions, creating systemic risks. Here we analyse cascading climate change impacts on the EU, originating from outside the region, and identify critical intervention points for adaptation. Using network analysis, we integrate stakeholder-co-produced impact chains with quantitative data for 102 countries across foreign policy, human security, trade and finance. Our archetypal impact cascade model reveals critical intervention points related to water, livelihoods, agriculture, infrastructure and economy, and violent conflict. Livelihood instability, with violence exacerbating conditions in conflict-prone regions, tends to amplify risks of cascading impacts emerging from low-income countries. High-income countries can trigger cascading impacts through, for example, reduced crop exports. Our findings highlight the importance of policy coherence in addressing interconnected vulnerabilities rather than isolated risks. Thus, agricultural intensification without integrated water management may exacerbate scarcity, whereas safeguarding livelihoods alleviates cascading risks related to forced migration, violent conflict and instability. Transboundary climate risks pose complex challenges, propagating across borders and sectors and affecting global supply chains, economies and governance systems. However, the ownership of these risks remains unclear, making adaptation efforts fragmented and less effective. This paper introduces a framework to map risk ownership in global supply chains, helping identify key stakeholders, assets and objectives at risk. By applying this framework to the case of Brazilian-produced soy products imported for fish food in Norway, we illustrate how climate risks \u2013 and the adaptation measures to address them \u2013 extend beyond direct supply chain actors to industries, governments and broader economic systems. The framework highlights the systemic nature of transboundary climate risks, emphasizing the need for coordinated, cross-sectoral approaches to adaptation. It also raises critical questions on fairness and responsibility, as differing risk exposures and incentives influence who takes action. Ultimately, the framework provides a foundation for improving risk governance and enhancing climate resilience in interconnected global systems. The Nordic countries, heavily reliant on global trade, are increasingly vulnerable to climate change impacts abroad. However, national policies and business practices often overlook these \"transboundary climate risks\" (TCRs). Key challenges: Diffuse risk ownership: TCRs are dispersed across multiple jurisdictions, sectors and value chains, adding far more complexity than conventional direct or domestic climate risks. A lack of business preparedness: Limited awareness and action from businesses. Policy gaps: National policies often overlook TCRs. Siloed approaches to adaptation: Current adaptation approaches do not recognise the need for cross-cutting actions that use multiple policy tools across diverse sectors Suggested solutions: Strengthening Nordic and international cooperation Improving risk assessments Promoting public-private partnerships to enhance resilience Medical textiles\u2014including linens, scrubs, towels, and gowns\u2014are essential in clinical settings but contribute significantly to healthcare\u2019s environmental footprint. California\u2019s Senate Bill 707 (SB 707, Newman, 2024) establishes the first textile Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) program in the United States, requiring manufacturers to fund and operate collection, repair, and recycling systems for covered textiles. This article, authored by the bill\u2019s sponsor, outlines the scientific, stakeholder, and legislative processes that shaped SB 707, with particular focus on its implications for healthcare. Through pilot programs and fiber audits, findings showed that most discarded medical textiles are reusable or recyclable yet lack adequate collection, repair, and reuse distribution infrastructure. The policy is designed to reduce costs, improve supply chain resilience, and lower climate and public health impacts\u2014without placing additional burden on healthcare providers. Hospitals and healthcare facilities can participate in the EPR program at no cost and are encouraged to support implementation by identifying eligible products, hosting collection sites, and advocating for reuse and repair within their systems."

    "research_summary": "Abstract A consistent approach to evaluate the annual wettest day (Rx1day) across global and regional gridded observational datasets is presented using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) to define climatological regions. Global daily 1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0 latitude/longitude gridded products available from the Frequent Rainfall Observations on Grids (FROGS) database are compared with regional high-resolution (\u223c1\u201325 km) daily gridded rainfall datasets using several interpolation methods and order of operation. Climatologies are calculated for each global product and region using the overlapping period 2001\u201316, with global datasets then organized into in situ, satellite, and reanalysis groupings and compared with each other and the regional reference. Our findings show that reanalyses (especially CFSR and MERRA-2) tend to be among the wetter products for precipitation extremes in most regions and that reanalysis groupings also have the largest spread. Perhaps surprisingly, regional datasets are often among the drier, if not the driest products in many regions (especially Southeast Asia, Eurasia, and the Middle East), and are almost always drier than reanalyses except in a few cases. Rx1day is significantly positively correlated in most regions and products except in a handful of cases where data issues are likely to affect correlations. Rx1day timing deviates substantially between products, but agreement is highest among in situ products (40%\u201370% of the time) especially in data-dense regions with least agreement among reanalyses (10%\u201340% of the time). Despite uncertainties, the mean relative long-term trend estimates in Rx1day averaged across global land areas, with respect to increases in global mean temperature, are close to 7% \u00b0C \u22121 . Significance Statement While there have been numerous global and regional assessments of trends and variability of historical rainfall extremes, there has been little coordination or limited ability to compare across studies or to use regional products consistently when evaluating global products. Our results show for the first time that despite large uncertainty in the wettest day of the year [annual wettest day (Rx1day)] estimates, regional (continental scale) gridded precipitation products are consistently drier than their global counterparts. However, the trend in Rx1day averaged across all products is broadly consistent with the global increase of \u223c7% \u00b0C \u22121 found in other studies. Given the huge spread in observations of daily precipitation extremes, our findings have implications for their efficacy in informing global monitoring, event attribution, and model evaluation efforts. Abstract Trends in seasonal average dry-bulb temperature T , wet-bulb temperature T WB , and dewpoint temperature T D over the last 42 years (1980\u20132021) were analyzed over the Southeast (SE) Asian and tropical northern Australian region. All three variables show broad positive trends in most areas, except for relatively weak, nonsignificant trends over northern Australia. Trends in T D and T WB are as high as 0.5\u00b0C decade \u22121 in parts of SE Asia, with generally slightly smaller observed trends in T WB than in T . Trends over the ocean tend to be less variable and slightly weaker on average. We observe an increased occurrence of extreme events in recent years (the 2010s) compared to earlier decades. The T , T WB , and T D extremes occur substantially more frequently during El Ni\u00f1o years, in addition to an underlying increasing trend. Significance Statement Heat stress, a combination of high temperature and humidity, is a major issue in the tropics, where population density is high. Increasing temperature and humidity trends and the occurrence of extreme dry- and wet-bulb temperatures across Southeast (SE) Asia over recent decades are of particular concern for human and ecosystem health. ABSTRACT High\u2010resolution precipitation products (e.g., km\u2010scale and hourly) are essential for capturing extreme rainfall dynamics and improving hydrological models for flood forecasting and related applications. However, single\u2010source estimates\u2014whether from gauges, radar, or satellites\u2014suffer from inherent limitations such as sparse spatial coverage, limited observational extent, and retrieval uncertainties. Multi\u2010source precipitation combinations can potentially provide a more accurate estimate by using the strengths of each source. This review presents globally relevant methodologies for constructing high\u2010resolution precipitation datasets, with a focus on sub\u2010daily temporal and km\u2010scale spatial resolutions. Particular emphasis is placed on their applicability to the development of a new multi\u2010source precipitation dataset for Australia (BRAIN: Blended Rain). We first compile and assess precipitation data sources specific to Australia, particularly those readily available to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. These include ground\u2010based gauge observations, radar estimates, satellite\u2010de"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Invasive species are one of the major threatening processes impacting biodiversity on islands. In particular, introduced rodents represent one of the most serious threats to island ecosystems, affecting a wide range of native plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. While nearly ubiquitous on human-modified islands, the last four decades have seen the advent of targeted rodent eradications, which have generally resulted in positive impacts for biodiversity. Invertebrates, which are crucial to the functioning of island ecosystems, are known to be negatively impacted by rodents, but their response to rodent removal is less well understood. The largest rodent eradication on an inhabited island was undertaken in 2019 on Australia\u2019s Lord Howe Island, which successfully extirpated black rats ( Rattus rattus ) and house mice ( Mus musculus ) more than a century after their introduction. To examine the impacts of rodents on invertebrates on Lord Howe Island, we collected arboreal and terrestrial species both pre- and post-eradication and identified them to Order. Total invertebrate abundance increased after the eradication of rodents, alongside substantial shifts in assemblage composition, however Ordinal diversity did not change significantly. Orders with large increases in abundance included Isopoda and Blattodea, while the abundance of Coleoptera and Polydesmida did not change. In addition, the abundance of large invertebrates, which are presumably subject to stronger rat predation, rose dramatically following rodent eradication. Our results suggest an ecological rearrangement following the relaxation of predation pressure and augment documented evidence of improved biodiversity outcomes for forest tree species, seabirds and land birds. The climate change impact and adaptation simulations from the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) for wheat provide a unique dataset of multi-model ensemble simulations for 60 representative global locations covering all global wheat mega environments. The multi-model ensemble reported here has been thoroughly benchmarked against a large number of experimental data, including different locations, growing season temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentration, heat stress scenarios, and their interactions. In this paper, we describe the main characteristics of this global simulation dataset. Detailed cultivar, crop management, and soil datasets were compiled for all locations to drive 32 wheat growth models. The dataset consists of 30-year simulated data including 25 output variables for nine climate scenarios, including Baseline (1980-2010) with 360 or 550 ppm CO2, Baseline +2oC or +4oC with 360 or 550 ppm CO2, a mid-century climate change scenario (RCP8.5, 571 ppm CO2), and 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C (423 ppm CO2) and 2.0oC (487 ppm CO2) warming above the pre-industrial period (HAPPI). This global simulation dataset can be used as a benchmark from a well-tested multi-model ensemble in future analyses of global wheat. Also, resource use efficiency (e.g., for radiation, water, and nitrogen use) and uncertainty analyses under different climate scenarios can be explored at different scales. The DOI for the dataset is 10.5281/zenodo.4027033 (AgMIP-Wheat, 2020), and all the data are available on the data repository of Zenodo (http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4027033). Two scientific publications have been published based on some of these data here. Land use is central to addressing sustainability issues, including biodiversity conservation, climate change, food security, poverty alleviation, and sustainable energy. In this paper, we synthesize knowledge accumulated in land system science, the integrated study of terrestrial social-ecological systems, into 10 hard truths that have strong, general, empirical support. These facts help to explain the challenges of achieving sustainability in land use and thus also point toward solutions. The 10 facts are as follows: 1) Meanings and values of land are socially constructed and contested; 2) land systems exhibit complex behaviors with abrupt, hard-to-predict changes; 3) irreversible changes and path dependence are common features of land systems; 4) some land uses have a small footprint but very large impacts; 5) drivers and impacts of land-use change are globally interconnected and spill over to distant locations; 6) humanity lives on a used planet where all land provides benefits to societies; 7) land-use change usually entails trade-offs between different benefits\u2014\"win\u2013wins\" are thus rare; 8) land tenure and land-use claims are often unclear, overlapping, and contested; 9) the benefits and burdens from land are unequally distributed; and 10) land users have multiple, sometimes conflicting, ideas of what social and environmental justice entails. The facts have implications for governance, but do not provide fixed answers. Instead they constitute a set of core principles which can guide scientists, policy makers, and practitioner"

    "research_summary": "Abstract\u2014 The rapid growth of social media platforms has transformed the ways individuals, businesses, and organizations engage with digital audiences. As platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, and X continue generating vast volumes of user-generated content, the need for efficient tools to interpret engagement metrics, audience behavior, and performance trends has intensified. Existing analytics dashboards offered by social media platforms often require authenticated API access, pose limitations on data retrieval, or are locked behind paid enterprise subscriptions. These constraints create barriers for students, researchers, and developers who seek to understand analytics workflows without relying on sensitive tokens or restricted datasets. This paper presents So Social, a simulated, web-based social media analytics dashboard designed for educational and research purposes. The system generates realistic synthetic datasets that mimic follower growth, engagement rates, trending hashtags, influencer statistics, and sentiment distribution. Using technologies such as Chart.js, JavaScript, and a modular frontend architecture, the dashboard offers interactive visualizations, cross-platform comparison insights, and user-friendly navigation. Unlike traditional dashboards, So Social operates without external API dependencies, making it accessible for academic learning, UI/UX experimentation, and prototype development. The platform also simulates advanced analytics, including sentiment analysis, trend forecasting, comparative metrics, and engagement-based ranking. Through detailed system design, implementation, evaluation, and student feedback, this research demonstrates that simulated analytics can effectively replicate real-world dashboards for training purposes, reduce the complexity of API authentication, and provide a scalable foundation for future integration of real datasets. The findings confirm that fake data analytics is a cost-effective, safe, and flexible alternative for education and early-stage product design. Abstract Assessment of current and future growth in the global rooftop area is important for understanding and planning for a robust and sustainable decentralised energy system. These estimates are also important for urban planning studies and designing sustainable cities thereby forwarding the ethos of the Sustainable Development Goals 7 (clean energy), 11 (sustainable cities), 13 (climate action) and 15 (life on land). Here, we develop a machine learning framework that trains on big data containing ~700 million open-source building footprints, global land cover, road, and population datasets to generate globally harmonised estimates of growth in rooftop area for five different future growth narratives covered by Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. The dataset provides estimates for ~3.5 million fishnet tiles of 1/8 degree spatial resolution with data on gross rooftop area for five growth narratives covering years 2020\u20132050 in decadal time steps. This single harmonised global dataset can be used for climate change, energy transition, biodiversity, urban planning, and disaster risk management studies covering continental to conurbation geospatial levels. Description (V2 - Latest): To enable easy integration in the workflows, we have provided the main datasets in the following formats: Vector dataset: Folder - Vector The global gross estimated rooftop area per FN grid cell for each SSP narrative is provided as a Geopackage (.gpkg) file (Results_Vis.gpkg) with polygon geometries at 1/8-degree spatial resolution in an EPSG:4326 coordinate system. The attribute table of this file contains FN_ID column representing the FN grid cell ID, and other columns representing the FN_ID specific assessed rooftop area. The assessed gross rooftop area columns are sequenced as BF_X_Y with X having values as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5 narratives with Y representing the assessment year having values as 20, 30, 40, and 50 for years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 and with km2 units. In addition, a CF column is added for each FN_ID entry that documents the Capacity Factor for rooftop solar PV based on the World Bank solar atlas. Raster datasets: Folder - Raster The global gross estimated rooftop area per FN grid cell for each SSP narrative is provided as a geotiff (.tif) files with LZW compression in an EPSG:4326 coordinate system. The assessed gross rooftop area datasets are sequenced as BF_X_Y with X having values as 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 for SSP1, SSP2, SSP3, SSP4, SSP5 narratives with Y representing the assessment year having values as 20, 30, 40, and 50 for years 2020, 2030, 2040, and 2050 and with km2 units. Numerical dataset: Folder - Numerical The global gross estimated rooftop area per FN grid cell for each SSP narrative is provided as a parquet (.parquet) file (Results.parquet). This file contains FN_ID column representing the FN grid cell ID, and other columns representing the FN_ID specifi"

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for assessing the science related to climate change. It provides policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific basis of human-induced climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for adaptation and mitigation. This IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate is the most comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the observed and projected changes to the ocean and cryosphere and their associated impacts and risks, with a focus on resilience, risk management response options, and adaptation measures, considering both their potential and limitations. It brings together knowledge on physical and biogeochemical changes, the interplay with ecosystem changes, and the implications for human communities. It serves policymakers, decision makers, stakeholders, and all interested parties with unbiased, up-to-date, policy-relevant information. This title is also available as Open Access on Cambridge Core. Climate Change 2014: Mitigation of Climate Change is the third part of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2014Climate Change 2013/2014\u2014and was prepared by its Working Group III. The volume provides a comprehensive and transparent assessment of relevant options for mitigating climate change through limiting or preventing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as activities that reduce their concentrations in the atmosphere. Working Group III (WGIII) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is charged with assessing scientific research related to the mitigation of climate change. \u2018Mitigation\u2019 is the effort to control the human sources of climate change and their cumulative impacts, notably the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other pollutants, such as black carbon particles, that also affect the planet's energy balance. Mitigation also includes efforts to enhance the processes that remove GHGs from the atmosphere, known as sinks (see glossary (Annex I) for definition). Because mitigation lowers the anticipated effects of climate change as well as the risks of extreme impacts, it is part of a broader policy strategy that includes adaptation to climate impacts\u2014a topic addressed in more detail in WGII. There is a special role for international cooperation on mitigation policies because most GHGs have long atmospheric lifetimes and mix throughout the global atmosphere. The effects of mitigation policies on economic growth, innovation, and spread of technologies and other important social goals also implicate international concern because nations are increasingly inter-linked through global trade and economic competition. The economic effects of action by one nation depend, in part, on the action of others as well. Yet, while climate change is fundamentally a global issue, the institutions needed for mitigation exist at many different domains of government, including the local and national level."

    "research_summary": "Reforestation has substantial potential for carbon sequestration in the conterminous United States. My inspection of the results of a recent novel study of potential reforestation in the US revealed potentially important issues in some locations related to harvested forests and productive cropland. Here, I describe a study that refined the methods to address these issues and included an assessment of the albedo impact of reforestation. One update to improve identifying forest harvest caused substantial decreases in sequestration potential. In addition, five different approaches were developed for updating the estimate of marginal cropland, allowing for variability in the definition of \u201cmarginal\u201d. Sequestration potential increased or decreased, depending on approach. Because these updates were somewhat offsetting, the summed sequestration potential for the US was about 86% of the original results. At state and finer scales, substantial increases and decreases occurred. Geographic patterns were similar to the original study, with highest potential in the eastern US and coastal western US. These areas of high sequestration would be less affected by the modified albedo following reforestation than other areas. The refinements described here likely result in greater accuracy and higher confidence in some locations and situations of potential reforestation actions in the US. The western spruce budworm ( Choristoneura freemani; WSB) is the most damaging defoliating insect in the Pacific Northwest. Despite general knowledge about climate influences on WSB, few studies have evaluated how outbreak dynamics are affected by local variability in climate. We used dendrochronological techniques to reconstruct WSB activity in Douglas-firs ( Pseudotsuga menziesii) at three low- and three high-elevation sites (representing climate variability) in Idaho, USA. We first tested different thresholds used in an established algorithm for determining WSB activity and found substantial variability in outbreak metrics. We then compared the timing of our reconstructed outbreaks with activity reported by aerial surveys, historical reports, and other reconstructions. Some agreement occurred in non-outbreak periods, but significant disagreement existed in the timing of outbreaks. Our assessment of topo-climatic influences on reconstructed WSB activity revealed that defoliation frequency was lower at low-elevation sites, with some inconsistencies depending on metric and threshold choice. Finally, we examined the influence of interannual variability of drought on outbreak initiation, finding no consistent effects. Our results reveal sensitivity to the choice of threshold of the reconstruction algorithm and suggest that more investigation is needed to better understand the role of climate, given future conditions that will likely be warmer and drier."

    "research_summary": "This chapter assesses past and projected changes in the ocean, cryosphere and sea level using paleo reconstructions, instrumental observations and model simulations. In the following summary, we update and expand the related assessments from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00baC (SR1.5) and the Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC). Major advances in this chapter since the SROCC include the synthesis of extended and new observations, which allows for improved assessment of past change, processes and budgets for the last century, and the use of a hierarchy of models and emulators, which provide improved projections and uncertainty estimates of future change. In addition, the systematic use of model emulators makes our projections of ocean heat content, land-ice loss and sea level rise fully consistent both with each other and with the assessed equilibrium climate sensitivity and projections of global surface air temperature across the entire report. In this executive summary, uncertainty ranges are reported as &lt;i&gt;very likely&lt;i&gt; ranges and expressed by square brackets, unless otherwise noted. A summary is not available for this content so a preview has been provided. As you have access to this content, a full PDF is available via the 'Save PDF' action button. This chapter assesses changes in weather and climate extremes on regional and global scales, including observed changes and their attribution, as well as projected changes. The extremes considered include temperature extremes, heavy precipitation and pluvial floods, river floods, droughts, storms (including tropical cyclones), as well as compound events (multivariate and concurrent extremes). The assessment focuses on land regions excluding Antarctica. The Working Group II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a comprehensive assessment of the scientific literature relevant to climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability. The report recognizes the interactions of climate, ecosystems and biodiversity, and human societies, and integrates across the natural, ecological, social and economic sciences. It emphasizes how efforts in adaptation and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions can come together in a process called climate resilient development, which enables a liveable future for biodiversity and humankind.

    "research_summary": "Abstract. Internal climate variability encompasses processes ranging from daily weather fluctuations to multidecadal interactions within the climate system. A large component of internal variability on sub-seasonal to multi-decadal time scales is associated with recurring patterns or \u201cclimate modes\u201d. In this study we provide an openly available dataset of eight major climate modes: Eastern Pacific El Ni\u00f1o (EP-El Ni\u00f1o), Central Pacific El Ni\u00f1o (CP-El Ni\u00f1o), Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), Subsurface Dipole Mode (SDM), Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Southern Annular Mode (SAM). These modes were derived from 23 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models, each with over 500 years of simulation data, ensuring robust statistical insights into their spatial and temporal structures. The datasets were validated against observational data, revealing broad-scale consistency and highlighting biases in regional features and amplitudes. However, regional discrepancies, like exaggerated warming or cooling in specific areas, were found. Despite these limitations, the datasets provide an important resource for understanding climate variability, conducting detection and attribution studies, and improving climate projections. All datasets are publicly accessible (Mohapatra et al. 2025; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17337105), supporting future research and policy development to address climate variability and its implications for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Abstract Warm water intrusions onto Antarctica's continental shelves have the potential to rapidly melt ice shelves and destabilize glaciers. However, uncertainties remain about the mechanisms driving these intrusions and their variability, in part because of limited ocean observations. Here, we use a high\u2010resolution ocean\u2010sea ice model to investigate the drivers of warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) intrusions in Vincennes Bay, where limited observations show that mCDW accesses the continental shelf and rapid retreat of the grounding line has been reported. We find large interannual variability in the simulated mCDW intrusions, with the vertical average temperature over the shelf below 400 m varying from to C on interannual timescales. The simulations show that onshore heat transport is facilitated by weakening of easterly winds, which drives a shoaling of isopycnals, allowing mCDW to access the continental shelf. The isopycnal shoaling also weakens the Antarctic Slope Current but mCDW intrusions are more highly correlated with change in isopycnal depth than strength of the Antarctic Slope Current, suggesting opening of an isopycnal pathway between offshore and shelf waters is the key process enhancing onshore heat transport. Ekman pumping over a narrow band of the continental slope is correlated with temperature on the shelf, suggesting that wind\u2010driven upwelling can also enhance intrusions of mCDW. Given the projected weakening of easterlies and strengthening of westerlies around Antarctica, results suggest that warm intrusions into Vincennes Bay will become more frequent, leading to increased basal melt rates and a heightened contribution of the region to future sea\u2010level rise. Abstract Meandering of a baroclinic jet in the atmosphere or ocean produces deep cyclones and anticyclones through a process known as cyclogenesis, driven by squashing of upper and stretching of lower layers. Our high-resolution simulation of a strongly curved meander in the Subantarctic Front shows that horizontal divergence created by ageostrophic velocities due to flow curvature in the gradient wind balance causes this stretching and squashing and is a good proxy ( R 2 = 0.35 at \u223c200-m depth) for identifying vertical motion within the water column. Vertical motions drive along-isopycnal flow, producing temperature anomalies in the upper ocean, similar to those in observations. A progressive warming from the upstream side of the trough to the downstream side of the crest matches the rotation of the horizontal velocity vector with depth and associated cross-stream heat advection. In the deep ocean (&gt;1500 m), we identify strong, coherent cyclones and anticyclones that are dynamically linked to the meander above and capable of transporting heat across the front. Around the cyclone, temperature anomalies depart from expectations based on cyclonic motion and the usual meridional increase in isopycnal temperature across the front. Localized around the cyclone, the meridional gradient changes sign, likely due to turbulent mixing and flow-topography interactions. Crucially, resolving these features requires a depth-dependent vorticity balance: Vertical averaging would obscure the eddy-driven heat transport and underestimate the influence of deep currents on cross-frontal exchange. Our results underscore the importance of meanders and deep eddies for the Southern Ocean\u2019s uptake and "

    "research_summary": "This chapter provides a discussion on \"U.S.-E.C. Farm Trade Confrontation: An Outsider's View\" by Kym Anderson. For the political reasons outlined by Professor Anderson, reform tends to be slow in coming. From the perspective of the traditional agricultural exporters the important thing about agricultural protection is not the effects on economic welfare within the countries who practice it, but the effect it has on world markets and trade. There are few countries that are blameless in the distortion of agricultural commodity markets. The trends in agricultural protection and the consequent effects on international food and fiber markets during the mid 1980s largely explain the approach taken to the Uruguay Round by the Cairns Group. It is indisputable that the interests of the traditional agricultural exporters and the many small developing nations around the world are best served by reform of multilateral trading arrangements and a strong and workable general agreement on tariffs and trade. This chapter examines the role of the Cairns Group of countries in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) negotiations. It presents a preliminary assessment of the potential effects of likely outcomes in the Round on the major trading regions and on Cairns Group member countries. The chapter also presents an analysis to suggest that global gains from the Blair House Accord are likely to be similar to those under the Dunkel package. A key feature of the United States and the European Community agricultural trade relations in recent decades has been the discrepancy between ideology and behavior. The success of international agreements, such as the GATT, depends fundamentally on the extent to which the most powerful signatories to those agreements are prepared to support them. A bilateral agreement on agriculture was finally reached in November 1992. This chapter aims to use Australia's experience with the collapse of its wool buffer stock scheme in order to illustrate the problems involved in using a buffer stock scheme and in disposing of accumulated stocks, particularly after the collapse of such a scheme. Wool is one of the most important export industries in Australia. The level of wool supplies in Australia is influenced by many factors including seasonal conditions, production costs, and returns from wool in both absolute terms and relative to returns from other agricultural commodities such as grains, beef, and sheep meat, all of which compete for farm resources. The 1987 act devolved responsibilities for setting floor prices and the tax rate to both the Australian Wool Corporation and the Wool Council of Australia. The potential benefits from the Reserve Price Scheme to wool growers need to be weighed against the operating losses of the scheme incurred by the Australian Wool Corporation over the life of the scheme. The effects of trade openness on food prices and its consequence on national welfare are extremely complex. The findings are subject to different circumstances and they cannot be oversimplified by the neoclassical theory of comparative advantage. In this paper, the aim is to examine the effects of trade openness on global food prices and national welfare in the light of the uncertainties of climate variability. Given that the net global agricultural productivity impact and the variation from one economy to another economy under a global climate event are highly unpredictable, a Monte Carlo method is used to simulate the wide range of productivity and geographical variations. \r\nBy assuming the percentage change of factor productivity shock around the globe is normally distributed under a climate event, the current version of GTAP model 6.2 plus the latest GTAP database 9.0 is run for 18,000 times by three sets of productivity shocks. Each productivity shock has 16 randomly drawn elements. Each element corresponds to an agricultural factor productivity disturbance to one of the 16 economies aggregated from the GTAP 9.0 database. \r\nOur results found that trade openness can contribute to reducing the volatility of the world food prices. It also has an impact to some degree on the level of the world food prices, but the direction depends on the impacts of the climate events. In respect of national welfare, it is found that while greater trade openness in the agricultural sector could increase welfare in the global scale, it does not automatically increase welfare for every region."

    "research_summary": "This study presents the first comprehensive evaluation in West Africa of four imputation methods, Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Ordinary Kriging (OK), applied to six core meteorological variables across Senegal over a ten-year period (2015\u20132024). By simulating realistic missing data scenarios informed by field conditions (e.g., power outages, observer absences, sensor failures), it establishes a robust benchmark for climate data reconstruction using machine learning in resource-constrained settings.The findings highlight the clear superiority of ensemble learning approaches. XGB consistently outperformed all methods across variables and scenarios, achieving the highest average predictive accuracy with R2 values up to [95 % CI: 0.82\u20130.88], along with lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). RF yielded comparable performance, especially for maximum and minimum temperature (TMAX, TMIN), maintaining strong stability even at 20 % missingness. In contrast, DT performance declined sharply with increased data loss, and OK was constrained by the sparse spatial distribution of meteorological stations, notably impairing its ability to impute precipitation (PRCP) and wind speed (WDSP).This work contributes a multivariable imputation framework specifically adapted to West African climatic and infrastructural realities. It also integrates block bootstrap methods to quantify uncertainty and derive 95 % confidence intervals for all error metrics. Results confirm that imputation effectiveness is highly variable-dependent: continuous and temporally autocorrelated variables (TMAX, TMIN, dew point temperature \u2014 DEWP) are well reconstructed, whereas discontinuous or noisy variables (WDSP and PRCP) remain challenging.Although ensemble models offer clear advantages, their computational demands and need for hyperparameter tuning may limit real-time implementation in low-resource national meteorological services. Furthermore, the exclusion of satellite or reanalysis inputs may constrain model generalizability.Ultimately, this study reinforces the role of advanced machine learning methods in improving climate data completeness and reliability in Africa. Although not a substitute for direct observations, imputation emerges as a critical complementary tool to support robust and resilient climate information systems essential for agriculture, public health, and disaster risk management under intensifying climate variability. In this work, the capacity of polycrystalline silicon solar cells when subjected to multispectral illumination in the frequency regime has been investigated using a numerical resolution method with the aim of making a contribution to this area of research. The focus is on the influence of silicon grain size and illumination frequency on capacitance, in other words on cell performance. Using a numerical resolution method, we have obtained results which show that grain size affects the optical and electrical response of cells when the recombination rate at the junction is less than 10 4 cm/s. The influence of frequency is also studied, showing that the capacitance is sensitive to the frequency of illumination when the recombination velocity is less than 10 2 cm/s. The study identified frequencies that enhance charge carrier generation. The results provide valuable insight into how to proceed to optimize solar cell efficiency based on polycrystalline silicon solar cell design, and pave the way for significant improvements in their performance under different illumination conditions. This article is a major contribution to the design of more efficient photovoltaic systems. Flooding in the confluence area of Rivers Benue and Niger remains a major environ-mental and socio-economic challenge which disrupts livelihoods, damages infrastructures and increase vulnerabilities in affected communities. The existing flood management in Nigeria relies on conventional engineering solutions, with limited to no consideration of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS). While NBS have been explored in other regions, their applicability to this area remains under-researched. This study assessed the potential of Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) for mitigating flood risks in this region through the integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), and hydrological modeling. Landsat imagery (2012-2023), Digital Elevation Models (DEM), soil, and climate datasets were utilized alongside HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS models, and Google Earth Engine (GEE) for flood extent analysis. Results showed peak flood coverage in 2018 (172.68 km\u00b2), followed by a decline to 99.12 km\u00b2 in 2023. Flooding trends were attributed to increased rainfall variability, land-use changes, and inadequate drainage infrastructure. A suitability analysis for NBS implementation identified areas appropriate for wetland restoration, afforestation, and sustainable drainage systems. The study highlights th"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Despite ambitious goals and policies, climate change adaptation efforts remain slow and insufficient compared to the pace and magnitude of climate change. Nature\u2010based Solutions (NbS) offer a holistic approach, with assumed co\u2010benefits that jointly address climate change adaptation and mitigation, biodiversity conservation and other societal challenges. NbS are increasingly implemented to enhance local adaptation to climate change; however, they remain mostly marginal and isolated considering the magnitude of the challenge. Therefore, pathways to rapidly scale NbS are urgently needed. We hypothesise that NbS implementors are limited in their scaling strategies by their decision context. We propose an empirical framework for systemic analysis of decision contexts for scaling NbS, showcased for the Grenoble Region in the French Alps. We use mixed qualitative methods\u2014policy and strategy document analysis, interviews and workshops with NbS experts, to explore a pathway to a conducive decision context. To characterize this context and the pathway to scaling, we identified the main leverage points, their underpinning levers and their interactions. According to workshops participants, NbS scaling should be supported by a combination of several deep and some shallow leverage points working simultaneously, including knowledge production and sharing, values and perception, local governance, supportive policies, financial support and landscape planning culture. Our results stress the need for more emphasis on how to support the integration of NbS principles into cultural roots and values; and on how to integrate deep leverage points into adaptation policies and strategies. However, this entails many challenges because of the diversity of actors with different objectives, values and power, and the multiple institutional scales and timeframes. We propose our integrative approach as a way to further support decision\u2010makers in navigating complex decision contexts for scaling NbS and building on simultaneous progress within each leverage point.

Abstract Successful adaptation often involves changes to the decision context to enable new ways of thinking and acting on climate change. Using 16 adaptation initiatives the authors were engaged with, we analysed how and why decision contexts changed to identify ways to improve adaptation as a process of collective deliberation and social learning. We used the scope of the adaptation issue and governance arrangements to classify initiatives into four types and scored changes in the decision context using three frameworks: (1) the values, rules and knowledge (VRK) perspective to identify changes to adaptation decision\u2010making; (2) the five dimensions of futures consciousness to identify the building of adaptation capabilities and (3) the social learning cycle to reveal evidence of reflexive learning. Initiatives using novel governance arrangements for discrete problems (\u2018problem governance\u2019) or complex, systemic issues (\u2018systems governance\u2019) scored highest for influences of VRK, futures consciousness and the social learning cycle on the decision context. Initiatives using existing management for discrete problems (\u2018problem management\u2019) scored moderately for change in the decision context, while those using existing management for systemic issues (\u2018systems management\u2019) scored low because change was often impeded by existing rules. All three frameworks influenced decision contexts in systems governance initiatives. Problem governance initiatives revealed interactions of VRK and futures consciousness but limited influence of VRK on the social learning cycle. Scope and governance arrangements differ with the adaptation issue and initiatives adapt over time: some small\u2010scale ones became more systemic, developed novel governance arrangements and changed the decision context. Our findings do not show that some adaptation initiatives are better or more transformative than others; just that their scope and appropriate governance arrangements are different. This questions the notion that successful adaptation requires building generic transformative adaptation approaches and capabilities. There is a diversity of arrangements that work. What is important is to align the approach to the adaptation problem. We suggest two directions for improving adaptation initiatives: first, by influencing how they can shift between problem and systems focus and between standard management and novel governance, and secondly, by using methods to diagnose and direct change in the decision context.

    "research_summary": "Myopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Sideroblastic Anemia type 2 (MLASA2) is a rare mitochondrial disorder caused by pathogenic variants (PVs) in the YARS2 gene (which encodes the Mt-TyrRS protein. We performed a comprehensive clinical\u2013molecular synthesis by integrating a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published MLASA2 cases with survival modeling and three-dimensional structural mapping. Across the aggregated cohort, anemia (88.6%), sideroblastic phenotype (85.7%), and lactic acidosis (82.9%) were the most prevalent phenotypes. Fifteen PVs were identified, dominated by p.(Phe52Leu) (29.4%). Survival estimates were 94.1% at 10 years, 70.7% at 30 years, and 42.4% at 50 years; cardiomyopathy and diagnosis before age 10 were associated with decreased survival. We generated the first 3D structural map of all reported Mt-TyrRS PVs, identifying nine spatial hotspots across catalytic, anticodon-binding, and tRNA-binding domains. An integrated framework combining structural density, clinical severity, in silico predictions, and \u0394\u0394G destabilization classified three clusters as High-risk, three as Medium-risk, and three as Low-risk. Among them, cluster 3, a large catalytic hotspot encompassing 44 residues and including nearly half of all MLASA2 cases, showed the strongest pathogenic convergence. This clinical\u2013structural integration provides new insights for a better comprehension of MLASA2, enhancing variant interpretation and improving diagnostic and prognostic precision. The All of Us Research Program (AoU) is a national biobank seeking to enroll one million individuals in the United States to link genomic and biomedical data, including short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing (srWGS/LRS), with rich electronic health record (EHR) information. Here, we present the first large-scale analyses of long-read sequencing (LRS) in AoU and offer a new framework for deriving genomic insights into complex structural variation (SV) of relevance to human health and disease. We performed joint analyses of 1,027 individuals self-identifying as Black or African American, sequenced to ~8x coverage with Pacific Biosciences HiFi technology and processed using cloud-native pipelines. From these LRS data we constructed a comprehensive variant callset encompassing known (FMR1 and HTT) and novel repeat expansions, clinically relevant haplotypes at loci inaccessible to srWGS, and haplotypes relevant to disease risk (HLA) and pharmacogenomics (CYP2D6), including SNVs, indels, and SVs. We developed methods for cohort-level variant calling and a scalable workflow to impute &gt;750,000 of these SVs into existing srWGS datasets for trait association and human disease studies. Expanding to 10,000 self-identified Black or African American AoU participants with srWGS and matched EHRs, we identified 291 SV-disease associations (p &lt; 1e-5) spanning 226 conditions with 50.9% of associations involving SVs absent from the matched srWGS callset. Across the 226 traits, after fine-mapping using SVs and SNVs we identified 191 SV-disease pairs spanning 160 traits (70.8%) where the SV had the strongest association within the locus. Associations specific to those with computed ancestry similar to the African reference population exhibited larger effect sizes and lower allele frequencies, consistent with high-risk, ancestry-specific variants. These results demonstrate that the integration of LRS into AoU and future biobank initiatives can provide transformative new insights into genomic variation with potentially profound impact on precision medicine. In studies of individuals of primarily European genetic ancestry, common and low-frequency variants and rare coding variants have been found to be associated with the risk of bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). However, less is known for individuals of other genetic ancestries or the role of rare non-coding variants in BD and SZ risk. We performed whole-genome sequencing (\u223c27X) of African American individuals: 1,598 with BD, 3,295 with SZ, and 2,651 unaffected controls (InPSYght study). We increased power by incorporating 14,812 jointly called psychiatrically unscreened ancestry-matched controls from the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) Program for a total of 17,463 controls (\u223c37X). To identify variants and sets of variants associated with BD and/or SZ, we performed single-variant tests, gene-based tests for singleton protein truncating variants, and rare and low-frequency variant annotation-based tests with conservation and universal chromatin states and sliding windows. We found suggestive evidence of the association of BD with single variants on chromosome 18 and of lower BD risk associated with rare and low-frequency variants on chromosome 11 in a region with multiple BD genome-wide association study loci, using a sliding window approach. We also found that chromatin and conservation state tests can be used to detect differential calling of variants in controls sequenced at di"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Obligate co-dependence can arise in symbiosis, yielding heritable partnerships. These interactions are considered to be highly specific, but partner fidelity is difficult to quantify owing to the experimental constraints of symbiont exchange between host species. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the unique transmission dynamics of Stammera capleta , the obligate digestive symbiont of tortoise beetles (Chrysomelidae: Cassidinae). Despite its extracellular localization, S. capleta possesses a drastically reduced genome (\u223c0.25 Mb) and is vertically transmitted through egg-associated spheres. Manipulating these spheres allowed us to experimentally exchange S. capleta between beetle species to determine their impact on host development. We show that non-native S. capleta can successfully colonize the symbiotic organs of a novel host, but that the interaction outcome correlates with genetic relatedness to the native symbiont. Genetically distant species trigger a more pronounced transcriptional response and can only partially rescue host development. While more closely related symbionts proliferate similarly to the native one and induce a comparable host response, they fail to propagate to the next generation, underscoring how transmission fidelity, host-symbiont compatibility, and local adaptation can further specificity within a Paleocene-aged partnership. Soil-transmitted helminths (STH) are common in (sub)tropical regions and primarily affect impoverished populations. These parasites reside in the gut, where they interact with both the microbiota and host immunity. Clinical STH detection is laborious and often not performed within the context of gut microbiome studies. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study assessing whether fecal metagenome data could be used to assess STH infection, and to relate STH infection to microbiome features. We leveraged 310 gut metagenomes obtained from mother-child pairs in two different locations in Gabon: one rural and one semi-urban, and assessed the presence of four STH species (<i>Ascaris lumbricoides</i>, <i>Strongyloides stercoralis</i>, <i>Trichuris trichiura</i>, and <i>Necator americanus</i>) using qPCR. Sequence data were used to characterize the microbiomes and to detect these parasites. Metagenomic read mapping and genome coverage metrics closely matched qPCR detection patterns. Within-location analyses revealed that parasite species richness was associated with microbiome diversity and taxonomic composition, with the strongest associations observed in children from the rural site. Applying this approach to published data from five additional African cohorts identified context-specific parasite-microbiome associations, as well as a modest but reproducible association between microbiome alpha diversity and parasite infection. These findings highlight the potential of shotgun metagenomics for concurrent parasite detection and microbiome profiling across diverse geographic and demographic contexts."

    "research_summary": "To explore differences between oral mucosa and gingiva in health and disease, we analyzed human single-cell RNA-sequencing data. In periodontitis, altered gene expression in junctional epithelium included not only inflammatory but also antioxidant genes, reflecting the potential of oral tissues to resist bacterial infection. Each cell type\u2014fibroblasts, endothelial, and immune cells\u2014expressed genes that distinguished mucosa from gingiva, as well as healthy from diseased gingiva. These findings provide insights into periodontitis and periodontal therapy. A hallmark of chronic and inflammatory diseases is the formation of a fibrotic and stiff extracellular matrix (ECM), typically associated with abnormal, leaky microvascular capillaries. Mechanisms explaining how the microvasculature responds to ECM alterations remain unknown. Here, we used a microphysiological model of capillaries on a chip mimicking the characteristics of healthy or fibrotic collagen to test the hypothesis that perivascular cells mediate the response of vascular capillaries to mechanical and structural changes in the human ECM. Capillaries engineered in altered fibrotic collagen had abnormal migration of perivascular cells, reduced pericyte differentiation, increased leakage, and higher regulation of inflammatory/remodeling genes, all regulated via NOTCH3 , a known mediator of endothelial-perivascular cell communication. Capillaries engineered either with endothelial cells alone or with perivascular cells silenced for NOTCH3 expression showed a minimal response to ECM alterations. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism of vascular response to changes in the ECM in health and disease."

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Disease duration is associated with lower treatment response and accrual of bowel damage in Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), but not in ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to understand intestinal transcriptomic changes associated with disease duration in CD and UC. Methods We analyzed intestinal tissue RNA sequencing data from two independent prospective cohorts of CD and UC patients, the Mount Sinai Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Registry (MSCCR; nCD = 498, nUC = 421), and the Study of a Prospective Adult Research Cohort with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SPARC IBD; nCD = 777, nUC = 440). We conducted differential expression analysis and subsequent pathway analyses of significantly up- or down-regulated genes, and examined cell type-specific expression of significant genes and pathways in ileal single-cell RNA sequencing data from CD patients (n = 18). We then assessed the association of significant pathways with treatment response in an infliximab-treated CD cohort. Results Significantly more genes were differentially expressed with increasing disease duration in CD compared to UC in both cohorts (MSCCR: nCD = 1472, nUC = 227; SPARC: nCD = 1248, nUC = 25; q-value &amp;lt; 0.05). A shared gene signature with 263 down- and 135 up-regulated genes in longer standing disease was identified. Pathway analyses revealed significant enrichment in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholesterol biosynthesis, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, and protein modifications. Pre-treatment intestinal gene expression of four disease duration-related pathways were associated with non-response to infliximab. Conclusion Disease duration influences intestinal gene expression in CD but significantly less so in UC. The identified pathways and genes may inform development of differing biomarkers and treatment strategies in shorter versus longer standing CD. Introduction: Genetic variants associated with nicotine dependence have previously been identified, primarily in European-ancestry populations. No genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been reported for smoking behaviors in Hispanics/Latinos in the United States and Latin America, who are of mixed ancestry with European, African, and American Indigenous components. Methods: We examined genetic associations with smoking behaviors in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) (N = 12 741 with smoking data, 5119 ever-smokers), using ~2.3 million genotyped variants imputed to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3. Mixed logistic regression models accounted for population structure, sampling, relatedness, sex, and age. Results: The known region of CHRNA5, which encodes the &alpha;5 cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit, was associated with heavy smoking at genome-wide significance (p &le; 5 &times; 10-8) in a comparison of 1929 ever-smokers reporting cigarettes per day (CPD) &gt; 10 versus 3156 reporting CPD &le; 10. The functional variant rs16969968 in CHRNA5 had a p value of 2.20 &times; 10-7 and odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 for the minor allele (A); its minor allele frequency was 0.22 overall and similar across Hispanic/Latino background groups (Central American = 0.17; South American = 0.19; Mexican = 0.18; Puerto Rican = 0.22; Cuban = 0.29; Dominican = 0.19). CHRNA4 on chromosome 20 attained p &lt; 10-4, supporting prior findings in non-Hispanics. For nondaily smoking, which is prevalent in Hispanic/Latino smokers, compared to daily smoking, loci on chromosomes 2 and 4 achieved genome-wide significance; replication attempts were limited by small Hispanic/Latino sample sizes. Conclusions: Associations of nicotinic receptor gene variants with smoking, first reported in non-Hispanic European-ancestry populations, generalized to Hispanics/Latinos despite different patterns of smoking behavior. Implications: We conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of smoking behavior in a US Hispanic/Latino cohort, and the first GWAS of daily/nondaily smoking in any population. Results show that the region of the nicotinic receptor subunit gene CHRNA5, which in non-Hispanic European-ancestry smokers has been associated with heavy smoking as well as cessation and treatment efficacy, is also significantly associated with heavy smoking in this Hispanic/Latino cohort. The results are an important addition to understanding the impact of genetic variants in understudied Hispanic/Latino smokers. Summary Background Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) improve type 2 diabetes (T2D) prediction beyond clinical risk factors but perform poorly in non-European populations, where T2D burden is often higher, undermining their global clinical utility. Methods We conducted the largest global effort to date to harmonize T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta- analyses across five ancestries\u2014European (EUR), African/African American (AFR), Admixed American (AMR), South Asian (SAS), and East Asian (EAS)\u2014including 360"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Disease duration is associated with lower treatment response and accrual of bowel damage in Crohn\u2019s disease (CD), but not in ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to understand intestinal transcriptomic changes associated with disease duration in CD and UC. Methods We analyzed intestinal tissue RNA sequencing data from two independent prospective cohorts of CD and UC patients, the Mount Sinai Crohn\u2019s and Colitis Registry (MSCCR; nCD = 498, nUC = 421), and the Study of a Prospective Adult Research Cohort with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SPARC IBD; nCD = 777, nUC = 440). We conducted differential expression analysis and subsequent pathway analyses of significantly up- or down-regulated genes, and examined cell type-specific expression of significant genes and pathways in ileal single-cell RNA sequencing data from CD patients (n = 18). We then assessed the association of significant pathways with treatment response in an infliximab-treated CD cohort. Results Significantly more genes were differentially expressed with increasing disease duration in CD compared to UC in both cohorts (MSCCR: nCD = 1472, nUC = 227; SPARC: nCD = 1248, nUC = 25; q-value &amp;lt; 0.05). A shared gene signature with 263 down- and 135 up-regulated genes in longer standing disease was identified. Pathway analyses revealed significant enrichment in pathways related to oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, cholesterol biosynthesis, liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (LXR/RXR) activation, and protein modifications. Pre-treatment intestinal gene expression of four disease duration-related pathways were associated with non-response to infliximab. Conclusion Disease duration influences intestinal gene expression in CD but significantly less so in UC. The identified pathways and genes may inform development of differing biomarkers and treatment strategies in shorter versus longer standing CD. Accurate variant penetrance estimation is crucial for precision medicine. We constructed machine learning (ML) models for 10 diseases using 1,347,298 participants with electronic health records, then applied them to an independent cohort with linked exome data. Resulting probabilities were used to evaluate ML penetrance of 1648 rare variants in 31 autosomal dominant disease-predisposition genes. ML penetrance was variable across variant classes, but highest for pathogenic and loss-of-function variants, and was associated with clinical outcomes and functional data. Compared with conventional case-versus-control approaches, ML penetrance provided refined quantitative estimates and aided the interpretation of variants of uncertain significance and loss-of-function variants by delineating clinical trajectories over time. By leveraging ML and deep phenotyping, we present a scalable approach to accurately quantify disease risk of variants."

    "research_summary": "Abstract Seafood processing wastewater, rich in organic carbon and nutrients, represents a potential low-cost medium for algal biomass cultivation. Here, we evaluated the growth performance of a naturally adapted microalgae\u2013bacterial consortium isolated from a seafood processing facility primarily handling skipjack tuna. The consortium was cultured directly in raw wastewater without nutrient supplementation. Within 9 days, chlorophyll concentration increased fivefold and total suspended solids nearly doubled, indicating substantial biomass accumulation. Dissolved organic carbon and phosphate declined by 85% and 68%, respectively, indicating nutrient assimilation by the microbial community. The culture also showed a pH increase, consistent with active photosynthetic carbon uptake. Ammonium transiently accumulated before declining during algal growth, while nitrate remained low and nitrite undetectable, indicating a nitrogen cycle dominated by ammonium with minimal oxidation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of valorizing seafood wastewater for microalgal biomass production and provide a basis for sustainable, resource-oriented applications of industrial effluents. Antigen-binding proteins, such as nanobodies, modified with functional small molecules hold great potential for applications including imaging probes, drug conjugates, and localized catalysts. However, traditional chemical labeling methods that randomly target lysine or cysteine residues often produce heterogeneous conjugates with limited reproducibility. Conventional site-specific conjugation approaches, which typically modify only the N- or C-terminus, may also be insufficient to achieve the desired functionalities. Genetic code expansion offers a powerful alternative by enabling the site-specific incorporation of noncanonical amino acids bearing reactive handles-such as trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-thereby allowing precise bioorthogonal conjugation via click chemistry. Nevertheless, identifying suitable incorporation sites that tolerate such modifications without disrupting antigen binding remains a time- and cost-intensive process, as this process typically requires labor-intensive screening involving the expression and purification of each candidate variant. Here, using HER2 and an anti-HER2 nanobody as a model antigen-binder pair, we present a convenient mammalian cell-based screening platform for rapid, purification-free evaluation of site-specifically labeled nanobodies. The nanobody is fused to blue fluorescent protein (BFP), secreted by HEK293T cells, and labeled in situ with a tetrazine-fluorescein probe. The resulting supernatant is then applied directly to HEK293T cells stably expressing HER2-mCherry. Labeling efficiency and retention of antigen-binding activity are simultaneously assessed by fluorescence imaging in the BFP, fluorescein, and mCherry channels. This approach enables efficient identification of labeling sites that support productive click conjugation while preserving binding function. It should be broadly applicable to other antigens and binders, streamlining early-stage screening of engineered antigen-binder conjugates for diverse applications. This paper presents a practical framework for \u201ceveryday leadership\u201d, a concept that emphasises purpose-driven, self-led, and ethically-grounded leadership accessible to individuals across all roles and backgrounds. Unlike traditional leadership models focused on charisma, hierarchy or fame, everyday leadership begins with leading oneself \u2013 through self-discipline, personal accountability, and mission-centered thinking. The authors propose three essential conditions for true leadership: 1. a concrete and enduring mission that one is committed to protecting beyond personal gain; 2. the willingness to pursue that mission with unwavering effort and humility; and 3. the ability to gather and align with like-minded individuals who share the same values. The paper further explores the tension between social and market norms, urging leaders to clarify their value system and hire team members whose motivations align accordingly. Drawing on real-world examples and behavioural insights, the authors highlight how seemingly small, everyday actions shape organisational culture and influence the \u201cmovable middle\u201d \u2013 the 80% of people whose behaviour can be directed toward good or ill. Leadership is shown not as a destination or title, but as a continuous process of choosing the path of significance over convenience. Ultimately, the paper asserts that the essence of everyday leadership lies in integrity, alignment, and purposeful action \u2013 and that the true measure of a leader is not perfection, but the courage to keep trying. This work provides essential guidance for healthcare professionals and others seeking to lead meaningfully within the challenges of daily practice.

    "research_summary": "Precision application of targeted therapies is urgently needed to improve long-term clinical outcomes for children affected by inflammatory arthritis, known as juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Progress has been hampered by our limited understanding of the cellular basis of inflammation in the target tissue of the disease, the synovial membrane. Here, we analyzed biopsies from the inflamed joints of treatment-na\u00efve children with JIA, early in the course of their disease, using single-cell RNA sequencing, multiplexed immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomics to establish a cellular atlas of the JIA synovium. We identified distinct spatial tissue niches, composed of specific stromal and immune cell populations. In addition, we localized genes linked to arthritis severity and disease risk to effector cell populations, including tissue resident SPP1 + macrophages and fibrin-associated myeloid cells. Combined analyses of synovial fluid and peripheral blood from matched individuals revealed differences in cellular composition, signaling pathways, and transcriptional programs across these distinct anatomical compartments. Furthermore, our analysis revealed several pathogenic cell populations that are shared with adult-onset inflammatory arthritis, as well as age-associated differences in tissue vascularity, prominence of innate immunity, and enrichment of TGF-\u03b2\u2013responsive stromal subsets that up-regulate expression of disease risk\u2013associated genes. Overall, our findings demonstrate the need for age-specific analyses of synovial tissue pathology to guide targeted treatment strategies in JIA. Abstract Objective Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), the majority of which are located in non-coding regions such as enhancers. This presents a challenge for pinpointing causal variants and their target genes. Interpreting these loci requires functional genomics data from disease-relevant tissues, which has been lacking for JIA. This study seeks to fill that gap and elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying JIA susceptibility. Methods We performed low-input whole genome promoter Capture Hi-C (PCHi-C) and ATAC-seq on CD4+ T cells from three JIA oligoarthritis patients. To link JIA-associated SNPs to potential causal genes, we integrated PCHi-C data with JIA GWAS summary statistics using our Bayesian prioritisation algorithm, Capture Hi-C Omnibus Gene Score (COGS). ATAC-seq was used to further annotate JIA GWAS loci in CD4+ T cells. We then employed CRISPR activation and interference (CRISPRa/i) in Jurkat cells to validate the prioritised SNPs and their corresponding genes. Results Chromatin interactions between JIA-associated SNPs and gene promoters were identified in 19 of 44 non-MHC JIA loci, linking 61 known and novel target genes to the disease. Through COGS, we prioritised seven putative causal genes for JIA: RGS14, ERAP2, HIPK1, CCR4, CCRL2, CCR2 , and CCR3 . SNPs within promoter-interacting regions (PIRs) of these genes were further validated using CRISPRa/i to confirm their roles in regulating gene expression. Conclusions This study provides insights into the genetic architecture of JIA by integrating genomic and epigenomic data, identifying disease-related genes, functionally validating risk SNPs, and highlighting candidate drugs for repurposing. Key messages What is already known on this topic Recent genome-wide association studies in JIA have identified genetic loci associated with disease risk. However, the precise mechanisms by which these variants contribute to disease pathology remain unclear, as most do not directly alter protein-coding genes. It has been proposed that non-coding SNPs can affect genes that are important in disease through disruption of enhancer-mediated regulatory mechanisms that control their expression, with enhancers exerting their effects through chromatin interactions. Functional characterisation of risk loci is essential to delineate causal SNPs and target genes in JIA. What this study adds This study is the first to utilise low-input Promoter Capture Hi-C to map long-range chromatin interactions in CD4+ T cells from JIA patients, alongside ATAC-seq to assess chromatin accessibility within the same samples. It identifies 61 potential target genes at JIA-associated loci and validates the regulatory roles of some of these through CRISPR activation and interference. This work enhances our understanding of how genetic variants modulate gene expression in immune cells, shedding light on key pathways involved in JIA pathogenesis. How this study might affect research, practice or policy Highlights new potential causal genes in JIA which can help understand the pathological mechanisms in JIA, and suggests the potential to repurpose CCR2/CCR5 inhibitors in JIA.

    "research_summary": "Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is defined by the expansion of a lineage of genetically identical cells in blood. Genetic lesions that confer a fitness advantage, such as leukemogenic point mutations or mosaic chromosomal alterations (mCAs), are frequent mediators of CH. However, recent analyses of both single cell-derived colonies of hematopoietic cells and population sequencing cohorts have revealed CH frequently occurs in the absence of known driver genetic lesions. To characterize CH without known driver genetic lesions, we use 51,399 deeply sequenced whole genomes from the NHLBI TOPMed sequencing initiative to perform simultaneous germline and somatic mutation analyses among individuals without leukemogenic point mutations (LPM), which we term CH-LPMneg. We quantify CH by estimating the total mutation burden. Because estimating somatic mutation burden without a paired-tissue sample is challenging, we develop a novel statistical method, the Genomic and Epigenomic informed Mutation (GEM) rate, that uses external genomic and epigenomic data sources to distinguish artifactual signals from true somatic mutations. We perform a genome-wide association study of GEM to discover the germline determinants of CH-LPMneg. We identify seven genes associated with CH-LPMneg (TCL1A, TERT, SMC4, NRIP1, PRDM16, MSRA, SCARB1).Functional analyses of SMC4 and NRIP1 implicated altered hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and proliferation as the primary mediator of mutation burden in blood. We then perform comprehensive multi-tissue transcriptomic analyses, finding that the expression levels of 404 genes are associated with GEM. Finally, we perform phenotypic association meta-analyses across four cohorts, finding that GEM is associated with increased white blood cell count, but is not significantly associated with incident stroke or coronary disease events. Overall, we develop GEM for quantifying mutation burden from WGS and use GEM to discover the genetic, genomic, and phenotypic correlates of CH-LPMneg. ABSTRACT Previous studies have developed proteomic aging clocks to estimate biological age and predict mortality and age\u2010related diseases. However, these earlier clocks were based on cross\u2010sectional data, capturing only the cumulative aging burden at a single time point but were unable to reflect the dynamic trajectory of biological aging over time. We constructed a longitudinal proteomic aging index (LPAI) using data from 4684 plasma proteins measured by the SomaScan 5K Array across three visits in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (ages 67\u201390 at last visit). Our two\u2010step approach applied functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to capture protein\u2010level change patterns over time, followed by elastic net penalized Cox regression for protein selection. LPAI was constructed in a randomly selected training set of ARIC participants ( N = 2954), tested among the remaining ARIC participants ( N = 1267), and validated externally in Multi\u2010Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) participants ( N = 3726, ages 53\u201394 at last exam). Using Cox proportional hazards model, higher LPAI was associated with increased all\u2010cause mortality (HR = 2.50, 95% CI: [2.15, 2.92] per SD), CVD mortality (HR = 1.79, 95% CI: [1.34, 2.39] per SD), and cancer mortality (HR = 1.96, 95% CI: [1.45, 2.64] per SD) risk in ARIC, with statistically significant and directionally consistent associations also observed in MESA. Additionally, higher LPAI was associated with increased multimorbidity and frailty. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing biological aging measures from longitudinal proteomics data and supports LPAI as a biomarker for aging\u2010related health risks. Abstract Background Discrimination impacts various health\u2010related outcomes and may explain the excess risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and related dementias in minoritized groups through associations with vascular and AD biomarkers related to cognitive function. We hypothesize relationships between discrimation and imaging biomarkers will be observed in minoritized groups. Method We used data from MESA, a prospective cohort study that enrolled 6,814 participants at baseline (2000\u201002). Exposures were experience of racial discrimination, and number of reasons for discrimination (1 or 2+ reasons) at baseline. During exam periods in 2016\u201018 and 2019\u201021, brain imaging with 3\u2010Tesla MRI ( n = 1372) and amyloid PET ( n = 422) were completed. The primary outcomes were (1) measures of cerebral small vessel disease including white matter hyperintensities (log WMH, continous), cerebral microbleeds (CMB, present / absent) and enlarged perivascular spaces in the whole brain (log ePVS, continuous); and (2) amyloid PET positivity (Centiloids \u2265 12.2). Multivariable linear (WMH and ePVS) and logistic (CMB and amyloid PET positivity) regression models were adjusted for covariates including age, sex, site, education, and inverse probability weight. WMH and ePVS models were also adjusted fo"

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT Congenital CMV infection is the most common perinatal infection, affecting up to 0.5% of infants. This elicits long-term disabilities that include neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as intellectual disability, microcephaly. Despite its high prevalence, the underlying mechanism of how congenitally acquired CMV infection causes brain pathology remains unknown. Here we discovered the molecular interplay of key host (DISC1 and PML) and viral (IE1) proteins within the neural progenitor cells, which underlay an attenuated neural progenitor proliferation. Abolishing the viral IE1 protein by delivering IE1-targeting CRISPR/Cas9 to fetal brain rescued this progenitor cell deficit, a key pathology in congenital CMV infection. A selective targeting to a viral-specific protein by the CRISPR/Cas9 system is minimal in off-target effects. Therefore, we believe that a pivotal role of IE1 in an attenuated neural progenitor proliferation in the developing cortex through its interfering with interaction between host DISC1 and PML proteins. Abstract Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder driven in part by mutations in three genes that encode components of the cholesterol pathway: LDLR , APOB , and PCSK9 . However, the majority of FH genetics has been performed in individuals of European descent. Here, we leveraged a cohort of 300 patients from the Mexican FH registry to understand how rare, high liability alleles and common variants might contribute to shaping individual risk. Using a combination of whole exome and of short- and long-read whole genome sequencing, we report three key findings. First, we observed that rare pathogenic point mutations and structural variants in all known FH genes, together with variants in APOE , CREB3L3 , and PLIN1 , contribute to a molecular FH diagnosis in 67% of families, including novel gene-disruptive CNVs which arose in a native American background. Second, ancestry-adjusted polygenic risk score analysis identified a significant liability for coronary artery disease, hypertension, LDL, HDL, and Type 2 Diabetes. The polygenic signal for LDL was present in patients with rare, pathogenic FH mutations and was more prominent in individuals bereft of a molecular FH diagnosis. Finally, we report both a whole-gene duplication and common, non-coding variants in a novel locus, PDZK1 , which contribute to the genetic burden of FH, a finding we replicated in the UK Biobank (UKB). Together, our analyses illustrate the value of genetic studies in non-European populations and reinforce the notion that individual risk to disease can arise from both rare, large effect alleles (alone or in combination across genes) and common variants that increase the mutational burden of a biological system."

    "research_summary": "Background: Due to the availability of effective lipid-lowering therapies, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) case finding is adopted by many healthcare systems. In parallel, polygenic risk scores (PRS) have emerged as a powerful tool for capturing the effect of common genetic variants associated with CAD. Research Question: What proportion of individuals at high PRS for CAD exhibit equivalent risk compared to FH variant carriers, and what are the potential clinical benefits of treating these individuals with statins. Methods: We analyzed data from the UK Biobank, identifying FH carriers via whole-exome sequencing and defining polygenic risk using a CAD PRS. Incident CAD events in statin-naive individuals were compared between FH carriers and individuals with high PRS. Number-needed-to-treat (NNT) with statins and number needed to screen (NNS) were calculated to assess therapeutic impact in high PRS individuals. Results: The top 8% of the PRS distribution exhibited comparable or higher CAD risk than FH carriers. This high-PRS group accounted for between 18 and 29 times more CAD events than FH carriers, depending on age. In the untreated high PRS group the rate of CAD events was 10.28 per 1000 person years (9.01 - 11.67) compared to 6.78 per 1000 person years (5.39 - 8.42) in the treated high PRS group, representing a relative risk reduction (RRR) of 0.34 (0.15 - 0.49). In the median PRS group, the rate of CAD events was 5.28 per 1000 persons (4.67 - 5.94) compared to 3.93 per 1000 person years (3.21 - 4.75) in the treated group, representing a RRR of 0.26 (0.07 - 0.41). The NNT in the high PRS group was 286 compared to 741 in the median PRS group, indicating that statins were roughly 2.6 fold more effective, after matching on clinical risk factors. The NNT (286) for statins in the high PRS group is similar to literature based estimates for statin treatment in FH (222) but the number needed to screen is approximately 21 fold higher for FH than for high PRS. Conclusion: In the population, screening for high CAD PRS individuals will prevent more CAD cases than screening for FH. This is because high PRS individuals are much more prevalent than FH individuals and have enhanced therapeutic benefit from statin treatment (compared to those without high PRS). The polygenic component of CAD is a major, treatable risk factor that is not routinely evaluated in prevention programs, despite a growing body of evidence that this can be implemented easily into clinical practice. Abstract Aims/hypothesis The nPOD-Virus group collaboratively applied innovative technologies to detect and sequence viral RNA in pancreas and other tissues from organ donors with type 1 diabetes. These analyses involved the largest number of pancreas samples collected to date. The aim of the current work was to examine the presence of enterovirus RNA in pancreas and lymphoid tissues of organ donors with and without type 1 diabetes. Methods We analysed pancreas, spleen, pancreatic lymph nodes and duodenum samples from the following groups: (1) donors with type 1 diabetes ( n =71) with ( n =35) or without ( n =36) insulin-containing islets; (2) donors with single or double islet autoantibody positivity without diabetes ( n =22); and (3) autoantibody-negative donors without diabetes (control donors) ( n =74). Five research laboratories participated in this collaborative effort using approaches for unbiased discovery of RNA viruses (two RNA-Seq platforms), targeted detection of Enterovirus A\u2013D species using RT-PCR, and tests for virus growth in cell culture. Results Direct RNA-Seq did not detect virus signal in pancreas samples, whereas RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA confirmed by sequencing in low amounts in pancreas samples in three of the five donor groups: donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-containing islets, 16% (5/32) being positive; donors with single islet autoantibody positivity, 53% (8/15) being positive; and non-diabetic donors, 8% (4/49) being positive. Detection of enterovirus RNA was significantly more frequent in single islet autoantibody-positive donors compared with donors with type 1 diabetes with insulin-deficient islets ( p &lt;0.001) and control (non-diabetic) donors ( p =0.004). In some donors, pancreatic lymph nodes were also positive. RT-PCR detected enterovirus RNA also in the spleen of a small number of donors and virus enrichment in susceptible cell lines before RT-PCR resulted in much higher rate in spleen positivity, particularly in donors with type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, the enterovirus strains detected did not cause a typical lytic infection, possibly reflecting their persistence-prone nature. Conclusions/interpretation This was the largest coordinated effort to examine the presence of enterovirus RNA in the pancreas of organ donors with type 1 diabetes, using a multitude of assays. These findings are consistent with the notion that donors with type 1 diabetes and donors with islet autoantibodies may carry a low"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Harmful cyanobacterial blooms present persistent risks to both drinking water security and wastewater reuse, driving the need for advanced treatment strategies. Treatment barrier(s) need to be capable of simultaneously controlling cyanobacteria, cyanotoxins, and co-occurring contaminants like bloom-associated antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) particularly in the case of recycling treated wastewater. Ozone nanobubble technology has emerged as a promising innovation, offering extended oxidative stability and enhanced interfacial reactivity compared to conventional ozonation. Hence this research objectives were to (a) assess the removal performance of ozone nanobubbles in eliminating cyanobacteria and their co-occurring contaminants in comparison to conventional ozone systems, and (b) investigate the repeatability of the results in varying background water qualities, ozone decay and the potential for by-products formation Ozonation using nanobubbles enhanced oxidation performance by 19%-34% in the drinking water reservoir compared to conventional ozonation while keeping the ozone concentration below 2mg/l. Lower oxidation efficiencies were observed in treated wastewater compared to drinking water sources, reflecting the higher content of organic matter and suspended solids, and oxidant demand characteristic of recycled water systems. Despite these challenges, ozone nanobubbles consistently outperformed conventional ozonation in reducing both cyanobacterial biomass and cell viability, underscoring their potential as an advanced \u201cpolishing\u201d step for algal management in wastewater reuse applications. By exploring fate of ARGs alongside cyanobacteria and toxin removal, this work extends beyond traditional ozonation trials. It provides valuable field-based evidence that bridges the divide between laboratory efficacy and full-scale operational performance. Future studies should build on this by exploring combined or sequential treatment barriers that enhance DNA degradation, thereby addressing both cellular and genetic risks in water supply and reuse systems. Observing the action of nanobubbles under dynamic, real-world water quality conditions is currently challenging; however, this study\u2019s novel field trials demonstrate potential nanobubble applications and provide valuable insights to guide future investigations. The results reinforce the broader applicability of ozone nanobubble technology for multi-target contaminant control in water reservoirs. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for food-borne disease (FBD) surveillance provides many benefits, including new insights in disease transmission, virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR), fast and precise outbreak tracing and source attribution, as well as streamlined and reproducible analysis through digital data that, from a technical point of view, can be easily shared. The National foodborne disease genomic data platform (the PATH-SAFE platform) will offer a trusted environment for WGS data sharing and analysis for UK agencies involved in FBD surveillance. Following the successful implementation of the platform for Salmonella, in the second phase the platform will be expanded to Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes. Where possible, the platform will draw on existing and validated solutions. For de novo genome assembly, EToKI and vanilla SPAdes provide the best results for E. coli, and Pathogenwatch provides the best results for L. monocytogenes. Analysis of genomic data is greatly enhanced by assigning genomes into well-defined cluster groups, which should be available on the PATH-SAFE platform. Specifically, tools for MLST and cgMLST should be available on the PATH-SAFE platform for both E. coli and L. monocytogenes. In addition, HierCC and ClermonTyping tools should be available for E. coli. The platform should implement tools for clustering E. coli and L. monocytogenes based on MLST/cgMLST profiles. Clusters should be named according to their HierCC codes. The PATH-SAFE platform should implement a tool for predicting E. coli serotypes from sequence data. ECTyper has been selected as the only up-to-date tool for this purpose. Although serotype determination of E. coli isolates is useful for historical reasons, the platform should be designed in a way that makes it easy to switch to hierarchical clustering of isolates. The identification of genetic virulence determinants is essential in the analysis of E. coli and L. monocytogenes. VirulenceFinder and AdhesiomeR should be implemented in the PATH-SAFE platform for virulence determinant identification in E. coli. The Pasteur L. monocytogenes Scheme has been selected for virulence determinant identification in L. monocytogenes, although none of the available databases seems to include all known genes determining virulence in L. monocytogenes. As the PATH-SAFE platform is expanded to new food-borne pathogens, integrating a tool to differentiate species will be useful. Speciator has been validated "

    "research_summary": "Abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated abiotic stress tolerance causes plant growth inhibition. Under such stress conditions, some mosses generate de novo stress-resistant stem cells, also called brood cells or brachycytes, that do not exist under normal conditions. However, the cell physiological basis of the growth inhibition and the stem cell formation is not well understood. Here, we show that the ABA-induced growth inhibition of the moss Physcomitrium patens apical protonemal cells (protonemal stem cells) is mediated through a shift from asymmetric to symmetric cell division. This change of the cell division mode, and consequently change of stem cell activity, is substantiated by dampening cell polarity and cell proliferative activity through the altered distribution of cytoskeletal elements, the mitotic spindle and the vacuole, which results in the production of stress-resistant stem cells. Alteration of the cell physiological data is supported by the results of RNAseq analysis indicating rapid changes in both cell polarity and cell cycle regulation, while long-term treatments with ABA for 5 to 10 days impact mainly the transcriptional and translational regulation. The regulation of cell polarity and cell cycle genes suggests growth arrest mediated by small GTPases (ROPs) and their guanine exchange factors (ROPGEFs) and by cyclin and cyclin-dependent-kinase complex, respectively. Our data suggest that a tradeoff relationship between growth ability and abiotic stress response in the moss is substantiated by ABA signaling to suppress cell polarity and asymmetric cell growth and may play a pivotal role in stem cell fate conversion to newly produced stress-resistant stem cells. The heterogeneity of cancer stem cells (CSCs) within tumors presents a challenge in therapeutic targeting. To decipher the cellular plasticity that fuels phenotypic heterogeneity, we undertook single-cell transcriptomics analysis in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) to identify subpopulations in CSCs. We found a subpopulation of CSCs with ancestral features that is marked by FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3 (FXYD3), a component of the Na+/K+ pump. Accordingly, FXYD3+ CSCs evolve and proliferate, while displaying traits of alveolar progenitors that are normally induced during pregnancy. Clinically, FXYD3+ CSCs were persistent during neoadjuvant chemotherapy, hence linking them to drug-tolerant persisters (DTPs) and identifying them as crucial therapeutic targets. Importantly, FXYD3+ CSCs were sensitive to senolytic Na+/K+ pump inhibitors, such as cardiac glycosides. Together, our data indicate that FXYD3+ CSCs with ancestral features are drivers of plasticity and chemoresistance in TNBC. Targeting the Na+/K+ pump could be an effective strategy to eliminate CSCs with ancestral and DTP features that could improve TNBC prognosis. Immune responses are different between individuals and personal health histories and unique environmental conditions should collectively determine the present state of immune cells. However, the molecular systems underlying such heterogeneity remain elusive. Here, we conducted a systematic time-lapse single-cell analysis, using 171 single-cell libraries and 30 mass cytometry datasets intensively for seven healthy individuals. We found substantial diversity in immune-cell profiles between different individuals. These patterns showed daily fluctuations even within the same individual. Similar diversities were also observed for the T-cell and B-cell receptor repertoires. Detailed immune-cell profiles at healthy statuses should give essential background information to understand their immune responses, when the individual is exposed to various environmental conditions. To demonstrate this idea, we conducted the similar analysis for the same individuals on the vaccination of influenza and SARS-CoV-2. In fact, we detected distinct responses to vaccines between individuals, although key responses are common. Single-cell immune-cell profile data should make fundamental data resource to understand variable immune responses, which are unique to each individual. In recent years, DNA methylation research has been accelerated by the advent of nanopore sequencers. However, read length has been limited by the constraints of base conversion using the bisulfite method, making analysis of chromatin content difficult. The read length of the previous method combining bisulfite conversion and long-read sequencing was ~1.5 kb, even using targeted PCR. In this study, we have improved read length (~5 kb), by converting unmethylated cytosines to uracils with APOBEC enzymes, to reduce DNA fragmentation. The converted DNA was then sequenced using a PromethION nanopore sequencer. We have also developed a new analysis pipeline that accounts for base conversions, which are not present in conventional nanopore sequencing, as well as errors produced by nanopore sequencing."

    "research_summary": "Abstract In November 2024, a highly divergent BA.3-related SARS-CoV-2 lineage, designated BA.3.2, was detected in South Africa, marking the first appearance of a BA.3-derived lineage in over two years. Phylogenetic reconstruction places BA.3.2 on an extended branch descending from ancestral BA.3, with no intermediate genomes detected, consistent with a prolonged period of unsampled or isolated evolution. Molecular clock analyses indicate accelerated divergence characteristic of a saltation event, while phylogeographic and demographic analyses point to a southern African origin followed by multiple independent exportations and evidence of ongoing global transmission. Relative to ancestral BA.3, BA.3.2 harbours 39 amino acid substitutions in the spike glycoprotein, two N-terminal domain deletions (\u0394136\u2013147 and \u0394243\u2013244), a four-residue insertion (ins214:ASDT), and a large deletion spanning ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8. The co-occurrence of D405N and R408S implies epistasis between these sites, while reversions R493Q and H505Y likely enhance ACE2 binding and antibody escape. Extensive remodeling across the spike, including loss of the C15\u2013C136 disulfide bond and substitutions in the SD1 and SD2 domains, may influence spike stability, cleavage, and fusogenicity. The emergence and continued circulation of BA.3.2 underscores the ongoing potential for highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants to arise and spread globally. Despite its limited prevalence, the persistence of BA.3.2 alongside dominant lineages, together with evidence of more recent expansion, indicates that this lineage retains the potential to become of epidemiological concern under favourable conditions. The ongoing threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) demands capacity strengthening in Africa for improved pathogen surveillance. The high-resolution picture of AMR provided by pathogen whole genome sequencing (WGS) can help close data gaps and inform disease prevention strategies, interventions and public health actions. Here, we report on phase 1 of the Fleming Fund-supported SeqAfrica project (2019\u20132023), one of the first genomic AMR surveillance networks in Africa. SeqAfrica established five regional sequencing hubs across West, East, and Southern Africa, expanded infrastructure, and delivered hybrid training programs to strengthen workforce capacity. During phase 1, the network generated 29,269 pathogen genomes (18,264 bacterial, 300 fungal, and 10,705 SARS-CoV-2) from 21 African countries, contributing to 40 scientific publications and substantial genomic data for national and global surveillance efforts, supporting outbreak investigations and antimicrobial stewardship initiatives. The median turnaround time from sample receipt to data release was 12 weeks (range: 3\u2013104 weeks), demonstrating the feasibility of genomic AMR surveillance despite logistical challenges. By nurturing a community of practice, expanding the workforce, and translating data into actionable insights, SeqAfrica has advanced the integration of pathogen genomics into national and regional surveillance frameworks. However, sustaining this capacity remains a challenge amid global funding constraints, procurement bottlenecks, and workforce retention issues. Lessons learned from implementation include successes in regional collaboration and persistent challenges in procurement, workforce retention, and metadata completeness, which informed the design of phase 2. As Africa continues to invest in genomic health infrastructure, SeqAfrica provides a proven model for embedding pathogen genomics into public health strategies and strengthening AMR surveillance across the continent. Abstract Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remains a major global cause of invasive human disease with clear seasonal variation suggesting a role for environmental factors. The pneumococcus includes &gt;100 serotypes and many lineages with different disease patterns. Interactions between microbial diversity, environmental factors, and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) remain unclear. We examined the effects of air pollution and meteorological factors on 59,017 IPD cases over 15 years, including 4,350 genome-sequenced isolates, using Bayesian spatio-temporal hierarchical models that link environmental exposures to bacterial diversity. Humidity and air pollution conferred the highest disease risk. In South Africa low humidity increased risk while high humidity was protective. Weekly PM 2.5 50 \u03bcg/m\u00b3 was associated with 4% cumulative risk increase with diversity-specific lag structures suggesting partially vaccine-mitigated risk. PM 2.5 risk was greatest in adults &gt; 65 and varied by disease type. Understanding these relationships may refine vaccine-impact models and inform air pollution policy targets. Routine use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) in South Africa caused a decline in vaccine-associated invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), followed by the emergence of non-PCV serotypes, driven mainly by pr"

    "research_summary": "In the last two decades, significant progress has been made toward understanding the genetic basis of type 2 diabetes. An important supporter of this research has been the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), most recently through the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Type 2 Diabetes (AMP T2D) and Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Common Metabolic Diseases (AMP CMD). These public-private partnerships of the National Institutes of Health, multiple biopharmaceutical and life sciences companies, and nonprofit organizations, facilitated and managed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, were designed to improve understanding of therapeutically relevant biological pathways for type 2 diabetes. On the occasion of NIDDK's 75th anniversary, we review the history of NIDDK support for these partnerships, which saw the convergence of research directions prioritized by academic consortia, the pharmaceutical industry, and government funders. Although the NIDDK was not the sole originator or funder of these efforts, its support and leadership have been pivotal to the partnerships' success and have enabled their research to be broadly accessible through the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Knowledge Portal (CMDKP) and the AMP Common Metabolic Diseases Genome Atlas (CMDGA). Findings from AMP CMD align with NIDDK's mission to conduct research and share results with the goal of improving health and quality of life. ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS: The Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Type 2 Diabetes (AMP T2D) and Accelerating Medicines Partnership Program for Common Metabolic Diseases (AMP CMD) were created to accelerate the translation of genetic and genomic data into knowledge about the biology of disease. Their goal was to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying types 1 and 2 diabetes and prediabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. This work identified multiple genes and pathways underlying these diseases. The findings of AMP T2D and AMP CMD have implications for drug development and improved risk prediction, diagnosis, and treatment for common metabolic diseases. Abstract Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often aggregate data from millions of participants across multiple cohorts using meta-analysis to maximise power for genetic discovery. The increase in availability of genomic biobanks, together with a growing focus on phenotypic subgroups, genetic diversity, and sex-stratified analyses, has led GWAS meta-analyses to routinely produce hundreds of summary statistic files accompanied by detailed meta-data. Scalable infrastructures for data handling, quality control (QC), and meta-analysis workflows are essential to prevent errors, ensure reproducibility, and reduce the burden on researchers, allowing them to focus on downstream research and clinical translation. To address this need, we developed GWASHub, a secure cloud-based platform designed for the curation, processing and meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics. GWASHub features i) private and secure project spaces, ii) automated file harmonisation and data validation, iii) GWAS meta-data capture, iv) customisable variant QC, v) GWAS meta-analysis, vi) analysis reporting and visualisation, and vii) results download. Users interact with the portal via an intuitive web interface built on Nuxt.js, a high-performance JavaScript framework. Data is securely managed through an Amazon Web Services (AWS) MySQL database and S3 block storage. Analysis jobs are distributed to AWS compute resources in a scalable fashion. The QC dashboard presents tabular and graphical QC outputs allowing manual review of individual datasets. Those passing QC are made available to the meta-analysis module. Individual datasets and meta-analysis results are available for download by project users with appropriate access permissions. In GWASHub, a \u201cproject\u201d serves as a virtual workspace spanning an entire consortium, allowing individuals with different roles, such as data contributors (users) and project coordinators (main analysts), to collaborate securely under a unified framework. GWASHub has a flexible architecture to allow for ongoing development and incorporation of alternative quality control or meta-analysis procedures, to meet the specific needs of researchers. GWASHub was developed as a joint initiative by the HERMES Consortium and the Cardiovascular Knowledge Portal, and access to the platform is free and available upon request. GWASHub addresses a critical need in the genetics research community by providing a scalable, secure, and user-friendly platform for managing the complexity of large-scale GWAS meta-analyses. As the volume and diversity of GWAS data continue to grow, platforms like GWASHub may help to accelerate insights into the genetic architecture of complex traits. Abstract Disclosure: S.I.

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT Minimally invasive interventions (MII) have transformed surgical practice by reducing patient trauma, speeding recovery, and improving patient outcomes. However, their effectiveness remains constrained by the lack of tactile feedback in confined spaces, reliance on manual dexterity, and dependence on radiation\u2010based imaging. Remotely controlled miniature soft robots that integrate tactile sensing, real\u2010time monitoring, and therapeutic delivery offer a promising route to overcome these barriers, but achieving such multifunctionality within a single device has yet to be realized. Here, we introduce an intelligent soft opto\u2010magnetic (iSOM) robot that integrates magnetic actuation, skin\u2010mimic tactile sensing, and photothermal ablation in a millimeter\u2010scale design. The robot comprises a compliant polymer sheath configured with optical pathways for sensing and therapeutic light delivery, a magnetically steerable body for controlled navigation, and a tissue\u2010conforming tip designed to provide tactile feedback and localized photothermal therapy. Driven by magnetic fields and laser excitation, the robot can actively navigate tortuous anatomy to perform targeted ablation therapy, while simultaneously providing real\u2010time feedback on both navigation and treatment to ensure precision and safety. Its capabilities were validated in proof\u2010of\u2010concept demonstrations, including real\u2010time tracked photothermal ablation in porcine tissue, targeted cardiac ablation in cardiovascular phantoms, and image\u2010guided therapeutic interventions in ex vivo and in vivo anatomical systems, underscoring its translational potential for high\u2010precision MII. Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the effectiveness of incorporating simple carotid ultrasound markers into modifiable conventional vascular risk factors (C-VRFs) on identifying the high-risk stroke population. METHODS: A community-based cohort study involving 3,506 participants (mean [standard deviation] age: 61.3 [12.8] years; 41.8% male), all of whom were free of stroke and atrial fibrillation at baseline, underwent carotid ultrasound assessment. The asymptomatic carotid atherosclerosis (ACS) was assessed by detecting increased carotid intima\u2013media thickness and plaques with or without stenosis. The new stroke events occurring during a 5.5-year follow-up were recorded. Nomograms for stroke probability by adding ACS to C-VRFs constructed models were developed and validated. RESULTS: Integrating ACS into C-VRF models further improved the models\u2019 performance for stroke prediction. Neither additive nor multiple interactions of ACS and C-VRFs existed. While comparing with group of none/mild ACS and C-VRFs &lt; 3, the risk of total stroke in the group with plaque and C-VRFs \u2265 3 increased by 2.6 times (hazard ratios [HRs]: 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.62\u20134.00) after adjusting for age and gender. The elevated stroke risk in the group of plaques with C-VRFs &lt; 3 (HR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.17\u20133.01) was equivalent to that with none/mild ACS and C-VRFs \u2265 3 (HR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.12\u20133.00). In the group with C-VRFs &lt; 3, 42.5% subjects had plaques, and 84% of those plaque-positive subjects were \u2265 60 years old. Moreover, the prevalence of nonstenosis and intermediate stenosis plaques was the highest, with the largest new stroke event occurring during the follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Adding ACS to multiple C-VRFs may improve high-risk stroke individual identification in the general population. While this modality may overlook the high-risk stroke population having plaques with C-VRFs &lt; 3, in older adults. Aim Investigate the role of mobile stroke unit (MSU) and rendezvous transport with emergency medical service (EMS) in timely large vessel occlusion (LVO) identification and direct transfer to the comprehensive stroke center. Methods The fifth-generation MSU (5G-MSU) program was first implemented in 2019, directly dispatched through the 120 emergency medical services. The rendezvous transport was initiated in 2020. We report the first case of rendezvous transport plus prehospital computed tomography angiography (CTA) on 5G-MSU for endovascular treatment of LVO. Results A 5G-MSU was dispatched for a patient with reported right-sided hemiparesis and reduced consciousness at a primary stroke center, located at a distance of 106 km. The 5G-MSU and EMS coordinated a rendezvous transport to transfer the patient. CTA performed on the 5G-MSU revealed basilar artery occlusion, prompting immediate contact with the main hospital's angiography suite. Upon arrival, the patient was directly transferred to the angiography suite for endovascular therapy, achieving successful recanalization. Consequently, the call-to-puncture time was successfully achieved within 103 min, across a distance of 106 km. Discussion Rendezvous transport combined with prehospital CTA on the 5G-MSU in rural areas is feasible. This approach allows the MSU to extend beyond its conventional treatment coverage, rapidly identify large v"

    "research_summary": "While the green revolution adapted a handful of crops to homogenous and high-input industrialized agriculture, much of the global population still relies on local food production from low-input smallholder farms that grow highly variable crop cultivars. The high diversity of the grain and bioenergy crop sorghum, and many other crops that were not homogenized during the green revolution, not only provides the raw materials for breeders to make substantial gains in cultivar improvement, but also constrains breeding efforts due to highly specialized locally adapted plant phenotypes. Here, we construct a 33-member pangenome and identify trait-associated variants in 1,988 cultivars and landraces. We then apply these resources to explore the complex interplay between historical contingency, ongoing adaptation, and the potential for future gains through climate-aware genome-enabled breeding. Specifically, our analyses conclusively demonstrate that multiple nested, deeply diverged, and previously uncharacterized structural variants in the domestication gene SHATTERING1 distinguish the previously established multicentric origin of sorghum. We then apply landscape genomics tests to reveal how gene flow, adaptation, and secondary contact created the complex genetic mosaic in current global breeding networks. Further analysis of climate-gene associations highlights candidate loci underlying adaptation, including the biosynthetic gene cluster for the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin. Combined, the pangenome-informed variants developed here will enable both trait discovery and subsequent marker assays to accelerate breeding and provide a framework for similar applications in other diverse and non-model crops. Abstract Multi\u2010parent populations are capable to dissect complex quantitative traits by capturing multiallelic variation compared to biparental populations. MAGIC B\u2010line (MBL) population is a multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population developed at Clemson University using four diverse accessions of grain sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] that are known to not restore fertility in A 1 cytoplasm. A set of 708 F 7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (Reg. no. MP\u20106, NSL 546930 MAP) were derived from the founders SC630 (PI 533937), SC605 (PI 534096), BTx642 (PI 656029), and BTxARG\u20101 (PI 561072) using repeated cycles of intercrossing. Each founder was carefully chosen to represent the four prominent sorghum races (kafir, guinea, durra, and caudatum) and capture important traits to segregate in the progeny, including stay\u2010green, plant height, waxy endosperm, and plant/pericarp color. MBL and their founders were phenotypically characterized for plant/pericarp color and plant height, flowering, panicle type, grain yield, and several yield components. The entire population and their founders were genotyped using Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArTseq) to generate 3751 quality\u2010filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genetic mapping of the MBL led to the discovery of novel marker\u2010trait associations (MTAs) in addition to confirming several known genes. During elucidation of MTAs, there were novel genomic loci that demonstrated pleiotropic effects for agronomic, grain yield, and yield\u2010related traits. With all founders are maintainers (B\u2010lines) of cytoplasmic male sterility, progeny lines serve as genetic resources to improve B\u2010line diversity, which can be limited due to a restricted number of non\u2010restorers in Sorghum bicolor . This population can be further exploited to identify superior alleles to enrich seed parent gene pool. ABSTRACT Phenotypic plasticity is the property of a genotype to produce different phenotypes under different environmental conditions. Understanding genetic and environmental factors behind phenotypic plasticity helps answer some longstanding biology questions and improve phenotype prediction. In this study, we investigated the phenotypic plasticity of flowering time and plant height with a set of diverse sorghum lines evaluated across 14 natural field environments. An environmental index was identified to quantitatively connect the environments. Reaction norms were then obtained with the identified indices for genetic dissection of phenotypic plasticity and performance prediction. Genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) detected different sets of loci for reaction\u2010norm parameters (intercept and slope), including 10 new genomic regions in addition to known maturity ( Ma1 ) and dwarfing genes (Dw1, Dw2, Dw3, Dw4 and qHT7.1 ). Cross\u2010validations under multiple scenarios showed promising results in predicting diverse germplasm in dynamic environments. Additional experiments conducted at four new environments, including one from a site outside of the geographical region of the initial environments, further validated the predictions. Our findings indicate that identifying the environmental index enriches our understanding of gene\u2010environmental interplay underlying phenotypic plasticity, "

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, including amyloid\u2010\u03b2 42 (A\u03b242), have emerged as essential endophenotypes in genome\u2010wide association studies (GWAS) of Alzheimer's disease (AD), advancing our understanding of AD biological processes beyond traditional case\u2010control studies. Using the largest sample size to date ( N = 18,491), we aim to elucidate sex\u2010specific associations with AD pathology by performing sex\u2010stratified GWAS of three well\u2010established CSF endophenotypes, A\u03b242, Tau, and phosphorylated tau (pTau181). Method We conducted meta\u2010analyses of sex\u2010stratified GWAS for each CSF biomarker, leveraging 22 US and European cohorts with available raw CSF and genotype data ( N = 6,785; 51.84% male; age=68), along with summary statistics from six external cohorts ( N = 11,706; 45.27% male; age=69). Consistent quality control was applied prior to genetic analyses, including z\u2010score standardization on raw CSF biomarker values in internal cohorts. The GWAS adjusted for age, ten principal components of genetic ancestry, and cohort\u2010array combination as applicable. We defined a sex\u2010specific effect as a variant association that reached genome\u2010wide significance in one sex and had non\u2010overlapping 95% confidence intervals of the effect estimates between sexes. Result We identified seven genome\u2010wide significant loci, including four previously reported loci and three novel female\u2010specific associations, including one for A\u03b242 (rs372578, p(Females)=1.86E\u201008, b(F)=\u20100.09, p(Males)=0.78), Figure 1), one for Tau (rs1582763, p(F)=5.56E\u201009, b(F)=\u20100.09, p(M)=0.05, Figure 2), and one for pTau181 (rs6434518, p(F)=2.95E\u201008, b(F)= 0.17, p(M)=0.80, Figure 3). The lead A\u03b242 variant, rs372578, is an eQTL for BMP6 ( p = 8.00E\u201004, http://www.braineac.org ), which encodes a TGF\u2010beta ligand involved in iron homeostasis and bone/fat development. Increased expression of BMP6 is linked to hippocampal neurogenesis defects in AD patients and APP\u2010transgenic mice. The lead Tau variant, rs1582763, is in the MS4 locus, an established genetic risk factor for AD with some evidence of female\u2010specificity, and has been linked to soluble TREM2 level regulation in CSF. Finally, the top pTau181 variant, rs6434518, is an eQTL for immune response genes STAT4, STAT1 ( p = 2.40E\u201002), and MYO1B ( p = 2.60E\u201002) involved in lipid metabolism and proteostasis. Conclusion Our results highlight significant female\u2010specific genetic associations across CSF biomarkers, underscoring the importance of sex\u2010specific genetic analyses in deepening understanding of AD genetic architecture. The complement genes harbour genetic variants that affect numerous diseases; however, these genes are notoriously repeat-heavy, and these repeat regions are largely unexplored for disease-relevant genetic variation. Elucidating these 'dark' regions is now possible using long-read sequencing (LRS), enabling identification of novel disease-relevant genetic variants. Abstract Rare coding variants across many genes contribute to schizophrenia liability, but they have only been implicated in 12 genes at exome-wide levels of significance. To increase power for gene discovery, we analyse exome-sequencing data for rare coding variants in a new sample of 4650 schizophrenia cases and 5719 controls, and combine these with published sequencing data for a total of 28,898 cases, 103,041 controls and 3444 proband-parent trios. We identify associations for STAG1 and ZNF136 at exome-wide significance, genes that were previously implicated in schizophrenia by the SCHEMA study at a false discovery rate of 5%. We also find associations at a false discovery rate of 5% for six genes that did not pass this statistical threshold in the SCHEMA study ( SLC6A1 , PCLO , ZMYND11 , BSCL2 , KLC1 and CGREF1 ). Among these genes, SLC6A1 and KLC1 are associated with damaging missense variants alone. STAG1 , SLC6A1 , ZMYND11 and CGREF1 are also enriched for rare coding variants in other developmental and psychiatric disorders. Moreover, STAG1 and KLC1 have fine-mapped common variant signals in schizophrenia. These findings provide insights into the neurobiology of schizophrenia, including further evidence suggesting an aetiological role for disrupted chromatin organisation. Abstract Objectives Polygenic hazard score (PHS) models can be used to predict the age-associated risk for complex diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). In this study, we present an improved PHS model for AD that incorporates a large number of genetic variants and demonstrates enhanced predictive accuracy for age of onset in European populations compared to alternative models. Methods We used the genotyped European Alzheimer &amp; Dementia Biobank (EADB) sample (n=42,120) to develop and evaluate the performance of the PHS model. We developed a PHS model building on 720 genetic variants, including Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) \u03b52 and \u03b54 alleles. We used Elastic Net-regularized Cox regression approach to develop the PHS model. Results The"

    "research_summary": "Genome-wide association studies have successfully discovered thousands of common variants associated with human diseases and traits, but the landscape of rare variations in human disease has not been explored at scale. Exome-sequencing studies of population biobanks provide an opportunity to systematically evaluate the impact of rare coding variations across a wide range of phenotypes to discover genes and allelic series relevant to human health and disease. Here, we present results from systematic association analyses of 4,529 phenotypes using single-variant and gene tests of 394,841 individuals in the UK Biobank with exome-sequence data. We find that the discovery of genetic associations is tightly linked to frequency and is correlated with metrics of deleteriousness and natural selection. We highlight biological findings elucidated by these data and release the dataset as a public resource alongside the Genebass browser for rapidly exploring rare-variant association results. Abstract The depletion of disruptive variation caused by purifying natural selection (constraint) has been widely used to investigate protein-coding genes underlying human disorders, but attempts to assess constraint for non-protein-coding regions have proven more difficult. Here we aggregate, process, and release a dataset of 76,156 human genomes from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), the largest public open-access human genome reference dataset, and use this dataset to build a mutational constraint map for the whole genome. We present a refined mutational model that incorporates local sequence context and regional genomic features to detect depletions of variation across the genome. As expected, proteincoding sequences overall are under stronger constraint than non-coding regions. Within the non-coding genome, constrained regions are enriched for known regulatory elements and variants implicated in complex human diseases and traits, facilitating the triangulation of biological annotation, disease association, and natural selection to non-coding DNA analysis. More constrained regulatory elements tend to regulate more constrained protein-coding genes, while non-coding constraint captures additional functional information underrecognized by gene constraint metrics. We demonstrate that this genome-wide constraint map provides an effective approach for characterizing the non-coding genome and improving the identification and interpretation of functional human genetic variation."

    "research_summary": "Antifibrinolytic drugs are used extensively for on-demand treatment of severe acute bleeding. Controlling fibrinolysis may also be an effective strategy to prevent or lessen chronic recurring bleeding in bleeding disorders such as hemophilia A (HA), but current antifibrinolytics have unfavorable pharmacokinetic profiles. Here, we developed a long-lasting antifibrinolytic using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting plasminogen packaged in clinically used lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and tested it to determine whether reducing plasmin activity in animal models of HA could decrease bleeding frequency and severity. Treatment with the siRNA-carrying LNPs reduced circulating plasminogen and suppressed fibrinolysis in wild-type and HA mice and dogs. In HA mice, hemostatic efficacy depended on the injury model; plasminogen knockdown improved hemostasis after a saphenous vein injury but not tail vein transection injury, suggesting that saphenous vein injury is a murine bleeding model sensitive to the contribution of fibrinolysis. In dogs with HA, LNPs carrying siRNA targeting plasminogen were as effective at stabilizing clots as tranexamic acid, a clinical antifibrinolytic, and in a pilot study of two dogs with HA, the incidence of spontaneous or excess bleeding was reduced during 4 months of prolonged knockdown. Collectively, these data demonstrate that long-acting antifibrinolytic therapy can be achieved and that it provides hemostatic benefit in animal models of HA. The serine proteases CAP1/Prss8 and CAP3/St14 are identified as ENaC channel-activating proteases in vitro, highly suggesting that they are required for proteolytic activation of ENaC in vivo. The present study tested whether CAP3/St14 is relevant for renal proteolytic ENaC activation and affects ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption following Na+ deprivation conditions. CAP3/St14 knockout mice exhibit a significant decrease in CAP1/Prss8 protein expression with altered ENaC subunit and decreased pNCC protein abundances but overall maintain sodium balance. RNAscope-based analyses reveal co-expression of CAP3/St14 and CAP1/Prss8 with alpha ENaC in distal tubules of the cortex from wild-type mice. Double CAP1/Prss8; CAP3/St14-deficiency maintained Na+ and K+ balance on a Na+-deprived diet, restored ENaC subunit protein abundances but showed reduced NCC activity under Na+ deprivation. Overall, our data clearly show that CAP3/St14 is not required for direct proteolytic activation of ENaC but for its protein abundance. Our study reveals a complex regulation of ENaC by these serine proteases on the expression level rather than on its proteolytic activation. The serine proteases CAP1/Prss8 (prostasin) and CAP3/St14 (matriptase) are identified as ENaC channel-activating proteases in vitro highly suggesting that they are required for proteolytic activation of ENaC in vivo. The present study tested whether CAP3 is relevant for renal proteolytic ENaC activation and affects ENaC-mediated Na+ absorption following Na+-deprivation conditions. CAP3 knockout mice exhibit significant decrease in CAP1 protein expression with altered ENaC subunit and decreased pNCC protein abundances, but overall maintain sodium balance. RNAscope-based analyses reveal co-expression of CAP3 and CAP1 with alpha ENaC in distal tubules of the cortex from wildtype mice. Double CAP1/CAP3-deficiency maintained Na+ and K+ balance on Na+-deprived diet, restored ENaC subunit protein abundances but showed reduced NCC activity under Na+-deprivation.

These findings support the use of genetic profiling for early identification and highlight new opportunities for personalized preventive strategies in psychiatry. Abstracts Cognition is one of the most widely used measure of brain health. Poor cognitive function reflects both the progression of neurodegenerative disorders and the decline of cardiometabolic conditions. Moreover, the genetic determinants of cognitive function are pleiotropic with various aspects of physical health and mortality. To date, little research representing the diverse Asian populations has been done. To understand the epidemiological role of cognition and its biological underpinnings in this population, we performed PheWAS on 542 unique research variables collected in the HELIOS Study (Singapore), with a dataset comprising 8207 individuals (Chinese: Indian: Malay= 69:18:13) aged 30-84 years in whom \u2018g\u2019, general factor for cognition, was derived. We used \u2018g\u2019 as a predictor and adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, the interaction of age and sex and genetically determined ancestries. We then performed 2-sample Mendelian Randomization and downstream sensitivity analyses using the GWAS summary statistics from the UK Biobank to ascertain causality. We found that \u2018g\u2019 was associated with a broad range of phenotypes (Bonferroni p&lt;8.1x10 -5 , 148 [27.3%] phenotypes), ranging from greater familiarity with digital devices (\u03b2=0.21, p=5.5x10 -138 ), to smaller waist-hip-ratio (\u03b2 =-0.06, p=2.5x10 -15 ) and lower carbohydrate intake (\u03b2=-0.07, p=3.5x10 -11 ). After further hierarchical clustering to reduce redundancies and ensure representativeness across domains, we shortlisted 23 (4.2%) representative phenotypes. The Inverse Variance Weighted 2-sample MR demonstrated causal linkage of genetically predicted \u2018g\u2019 with 14 demographic and physiological phenotypes, including less body fat percentage, lower alcohol consumptions, higher polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fatty acids (PUFA/MUFA) consumptions, household income and total year of education, with significant horizonal pleiotropy. From the initial 147 SNPs in the instrument-exposure \u2018g\u2019 , we selected 134 SNPs which uniquely predicts \u2018 g \u2019 and performed further annotations. The SNPs are linked with genes involved in neural development, neurotransmission, neuroprotection, and chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation. Our study demonstrates broad implications of cognitive function in lifestyle choices and cardiometabolic health indices as potential targets for early health maintenance at population levels. Furthermore, the HELIOS Study addresses the diversity gap in the cognitive genetic research and presents an opportunity to improve the cardiometabolic and cognitive health in this multiethnic Asian populations. Importance Peripheral (blood-based) biomarkers for psychiatric illness could benefit diagnosis and treatment, but research to date has typically been low throughput, and traditional case-control studies are subject to potential confounds of treatment and other exposures. Large-scale 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) can examine the potentially causal impact of circulating proteins on neuropsychiatric phenotypes without these confounds. Objective To identify circulating proteins associated with risk for schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD), and major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as cognitive task performance (CTP). Design, Setting, and Participants In a 2-sample MR design, significant proteomic quantitative trait loci were used as candidate instruments, obtained from 2 large-scale plasma proteomics datasets: the UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (2923 proteins per 34 557 UK individuals) and deCODE Genetics (4719 proteins per 35 559 Icelandic individuals). Data analysis was performed from November 2023 to November 2024. Exposure Genetic influence on circulating levels of proteins in plasma. Main Outcomes and Measures Outcome measures were summary statistics drawn from recent large-scale genome-wide association studies for SCZ (67 323 cases and 93 456 controls), BD (40 463 cases and 313 436 controls), MDD (166 773 cases and 507 679 controls), and CTP (215 333 individuals). MR was carried out for each phenotype, and proteins that showed statistically significant (Bonferroni-corrected P &amp;amp;lt; .05) associations from MR analysis were used for pathway, protein-protein interaction, drug target enrichment, and potential druggability analysis for each outcome phenotype separately. Results MR analysis revealed 113 Bonferroni-corrected associations (46 novel) involving 91 proteins across the 4 outcome phenotypes. Immune-related proteins, such as interleukins and complement factors, showed pleiotropic effects across multiple outcome phenotypes. Drug target enrichment analysis provided support for r"

    "research_summary": "Alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a lethal zoonosis caused by infiltrative growth of the metacestode larva of the tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis in host organs. We previously showed that the Echinococcus metacestode is an evolutionarily unique, broadly posteriorized tissue, leading us to hypothesize that canonical WNT (cWNT) signalling, which patterns the body axis across metazoans, might be critical for metacestode formation. Here, we report effective RNAi-mediated knockdown of the E. multilocularis beta-catenin gene (bcat-1), the central effector of cWNT signalling, in a primary parasite cell culture system that produces metacestode vesicles. bcat-1(RNAi) cultures were markedly impaired in vesicle formation, exhibited stem-cell hyperproliferation, and displayed disrupted muscle-fibre organisation. Genome-wide transcriptomics revealed a general anteriorization of gene expression, and in situ hybridization showed an overproduction of cells expressing head-inducing factors such as sfrp upon bcat-1 knockdown. Conversely, metacestode-specific genes including the tegumental factors muc-1, TNFR, and antigen B as well as the posterior marker post2b were significantly downregulated, consistent with the observed vesicle-formation defects. In situ analyses further identified anterior markers frizzled-10, nou-darake, notum, and follistatin that were overexpressed in bcat-1(RNAi) cultures and localized to the future anterior pole at the earliest stages of protoscolex formation. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of WNT signalling with pyrvinium pamoate caused complete loss of posterior tissue in Echinococcus protoscoleces, killed metacestode vesicles, and reduced stem-cell proliferation at nanomolar concentrations. Together, these findings establish a central role for cWNT signalling in directing Echinococcus body-axis formation and the posteriorization events driving metacestode growth within the host, providing insight into asexual parasite proliferation mediated by this biologically unique larval stage and pointing to potential targets for chemotherapy against AE. This protocol summarises the workflow employed by Project Psyche (https://www.projectpsyche.org/) \u2013 a collaborative project which aims to generate chromosome-level reference genomes for all 11,000 species of Lepidoptera found in Europe. The parasitic nematode Teladorsagia circumcincta is one of the most important pathogens of sheep and goats in temperate climates worldwide and can rapidly evolve resistance to drugs used to control it. To understand the genetics of drug resistance, we have generated a highly contiguous genome assembly for the UK T . circumcincta isolate, MTci2. Assembly using PacBio long-reads and Hi-C long-molecule scaffolding together with manual curation resulted in a 573 Mb assembly (N50 = 84 Mb, total scaffolds = 1,286) with five autosomal and one sex-linked chromosomal-scale scaffolds consistent with its karyotype. The genome resource was further improved via annotation of 22,948 genes, with manual curation of over 3,200 of these, resulting in a robust and near complete resource (96.3% complete protein BUSCOs) to support basic and applied research on this important veterinary pathogen. Genome-wide analyses of drug resistance, combining evidence from three distinct experiments, identified selection around known candidate genes for benzimidazole, levamisole and ivermectin resistance, as well as novel regions associated with ivermectin and moxidectin resistance. These insights into contemporary and historic genetic selection further emphasise the importance of contiguous genome assemblies in interpreting genome-wide genetic variation associated with drug resistance and identifying key loci to prioritise in developing diagnostic markers of anthelmintic resistance to support parasite control. Abstract Studies on transcription regulation in platyhelminth development are scarce, especially for parasitic flatworms. Here, we employed single-cell transcriptomics to identify genes involved in reproductive development in the trematode model Schistosoma mansoni. This parasite causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected infectious disease affecting &amp;gt;240 million people worldwide. The pathology of schistosomiasis is closely associated with schistosome eggs deposited in host organs including the liver. Unlike other trematodes, schistosomes exhibit distinct sexes, with egg production reliant on the pairing-dependent maturation of female reproductive organs. Despite this significance, the molecular mechanisms underlying ovary development and oocyte differentiation remain largely unexplored. Utilizing an organ isolation approach for S. mansoni, we extracted ovaries of paired females followed by single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with disassociated oocytes. A total of 1967 oocytes expressing 7872 genes passed quality control (QC) filtering. Unsupervised clustering revealed four distinct cell clusters: somatic, germ cells and progeny, intermed"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Vertical transmission is the leading mode of HIV\u20101 acquisition in children and is largely preventable through timely diagnosis and treatment of the mother. However, late diagnosis of HIV\u20101 in children and young adults highlights systemic failures in prevention and diagnostics. This study aimed to characterize HIV\u20101 transmission pathways and identify diagnostic gaps through the analysis of mother\u2013child pairs living with HIV\u20101. Setting The study focused on four mother\u2013child pairs, all of Ethiopian origin, identified in Israel after the children reached young adulthood. All mothers were unaware of their HIV\u20101 status prior to migration to Israel. Methods A multidisciplinary approach integrating phylogenetic analysis of HIV\u20101 pol sequences, molecular clock techniques and demographic and clinical data was used to investigate sources and timing of HIV\u20101 transmission. Results Two children had strains distinct from their mothers' viruses, including one case of a different subtype, suggesting horizontal transmission. Two other children harboured viruses closely related to their mothers', consistent with perinatal vertical transmission. Molecular clock analysis dated the transmission to the year of birth. One young adult exhibited undetectable viral load without treatment, classifying them as an HIV\u20101 elite controller. Conclusion Although the size of our sample was small, this study demonstrates the challenges in HIV\u20101 diagnosis in migrant populations. HIV\u20101 transmission pathways among migrant families show heterogeneity, with gaps in prevention and diagnostics. Targeted policies and improved diagnostic frameworks are essential to address under\u2010diagnosis and late detection, particularly in migrant and priority populations. Viral recombination is widely considered a potent driver of adaptation, yet the epidemiological factors that influence it and the extent of its contribution to overall fitness gains of a virus remain poorly understood. In this study, we leverage three years of extensive genomic and epidemiological data collected globally for SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic, combined with large-scale, unbiased recombination inference methods, to investigate recombination through an epidemiological lens. Using over 2,000 recombination events inferred from 16 million SARS-CoV-2 genomes, we show that the rate of detectable recombination is driven primarily by the standing viral genetic diversity in the population, and, to a lesser extent, by the number of infections. Our analysis highlights that &gt;80% of detectable recombination events produce viruses with neutral or reduced fitness, indicating that recombination is consistent with the 'nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution'. We also find that recombination induces larger shifts in fitness, both positive and negative, than single-nucleotide substitutions, particularly when recombinants arise from genetically divergent parental lineages. We observe that recombination between genetically divergent parents can lead to two types of epidemiological consequences. In very rare instances, &lt;0.8% of all recombination events, it can lead to highly transmissible variants with substantial and immediate fitness gains. Additionally, seemingly neutral fitness effects arising from recombination between divergent parents, which arise more frequently (12.4% of all recombinants), may pose a subtler risk by discovering novel areas within the fitness landscape, thereby creating new pathways for rapid adaptation. These findings not only deepen our understanding of viral recombination but also have important implications for genomic surveillance efforts during a pandemic, such as to identify the high-risk periods for the emergence of recombinant variants and to guide interventions."

    "research_summary": "Our work shows that general features control a much larger fraction of the variance in translation rates than previously realized. We provide a more detailed and accurate understanding of the aspects of RNA structure that directs translation in diverse eukaryotes. In addition, we note that the strongly correlated regulation between and within cis-control features will cause more even densities of translational complexes along each mRNA and therefore more efficient use of the translation machinery by the cell. ABSTRACT BACKGROUND General translational cis -elements are present in the mRNAs of all genes and affect the recruitment, assembly, and progress of preinitiation complexes and the ribosome under many physiological states. These elements are: mRNA folding, upstream open reading frames, specific nucleotides flanking the initiating AUG codon, protein coding sequence length, and codon usage. The quantitative contributions of these sequence features and how and why they coordinate together to control translation rates are not well understood. RESULTS Here we show that these sequence features specify 42%\u201381% of the variance in translation rates in S . cerevisiae, S . pombe, Arabidopsis thaliana, M . musculus , and H . Sapiens . We establish that control by RNA secondary structure is chiefly mediated by highly folded 25\u201360 nucleotide segments within mRNA 5\u2019 regions; that changes in tri-nucleotide frequencies between highly and poorly translated 5\u2019 regions are correlated between all species; and that control by distinct biochemical processes is extensively correlated as is regulation by a single process acting in different parts of the same mRNA. CONCLUSIONS Our work shows that the general features control a much larger fraction of the variance in translation rates than previously realized. We provide a more detailed and accurate understanding of the aspects of RNA structure that direct translation in diverse eukaryotes. In addition, we note that the strongly correlated regulation between and within cis -control features will cause more even densities of translational complexes along each mRNA and therefore more efficient use of the translation machinery by the cell.

    "research_summary": "Abstract Inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a group of monogenic diseases of diverse pathogenesis manifesting as single or multilineage cytopenia typically due to hypoproliferative dyshematopoiesis. Accurately diagnosing IBMFS is challenging given the overlapping clinicopathological features between individual genetic syndromes as well as with acquired BMFS (e.g. immune aplastic anemia). Accurate genetic diagnosis in IBMFS is critical and most commonly involves targeted panel DNA sequencing or whole exome sequencing. These approaches do not cover the full spectrum of possible genomic abnormalities which in turn may contribute to a significant proportion of patients with IBMFS remaining undiagnosed. We aimed to comprehensively evaluate the unbiased upfront approach of whole genome transcriptome sequencing (WGTS) in patients with suspected IBMFS (the IBMDx study). The IBMDx study aimed to (i) determine the diagnostic rate and clinical impact of upfront WGTS (ii) assess the acceptability of WGTS to patients and physicians through an implementation science framework (iii) evaluate the health-economic impact and cost-effectiveness of the approach and (iv) discover and functionally characterize novel genes and variants in IBMFS. 237 patients were enrolled from March 2022 to March 2025. The median age of the cohort was 30 years (range 6m-78 years; M:F 0.93:1). 70/237 (29.5%) were under 18 years. WGS was performed exclusively on non-hematological DNA (hair follicle DNA [n=178], skin biopsy/cultured skin fibroblasts [n=59]). Trio WGS was performed in 18 families. WGS was performed by a clinically accredited service and results returned to physicians/patients in real time for patient management and segregation/predictive testing as required. A genomic diagnosis for the hematological phenotype was established in 88/237 (37.1%) patients. Diagnoses made included hereditary thrombocytopenia (n=19), telomere biology disorders (TBDs) (n=14), Diamond-Blackfan anemia (n=12), primary red cell disorders (n=6), severe congenital neutropenia (n=6), Shwachman Diamond Syndrome (n=5) and Fanconi anemia (n=4). Targeted sequencing of the hematological compartment demonstrated clonal hematopoiesis in 32/217 (14.7%) patients. In addition, four patients had genetic diagnoses made of symptomatic and clinically significant diseases unrelated to the hematological phenotype (TAP2, IRF2BP2, ACADM and mosaic trisomy 7). Secondary genomic findings requiring further management were detected in 7 patients (TNNI3, MSH6, Monosomy X mosaic, BRCA1, BRIP1, ATM, FBN1). WGTS revealed novel genomic abnormalities not previously established in IBMFS such as retrotransposon-mediated gene disruption, polyadenylation site loss and disruption of novel regulatory regions. Novel genomic abnormalities in genes associated with Diamond-Blackfan anaemia (RPL31), TBDs (TERT/TERC) and hereditary thrombocytopenia (TPM4) underwent in vivo and in vitro functional assessment to inform pathogenicity. Finally, novel associations were identified with primary IBMFS-like presentations (THRA) as well as definitive evidence of gene-disease association were established (MEIS1, TUBB). Using a formal Theoretical Framework of Acceptability, WGTS was found to be highly acceptable to patients and carers as evidenced by positive perceptions of clinicians, alignment with healthcare expectations, and minimal effort required to participate. However, concern regarding equity of access to technology for all patients with suspected IBMFS was a recurrent theme amongst patients and carers interviewed. Health economic analysis showed that the cost of achieving maximum diagnostic yield, incorporating varied diagnostic strategies, to be between $7,800 - $8,200 USD per hematological diagnosis. In summary, we have comprehensively evaluated upfront WGTS in a large cohort of adult and pediatric patients with suspected IBMFS and have found this approach has a high diagnostic rate (37.1%), is highly acceptable to patients, and uncovered multiple genomic abnormalities that would have been missed with more traditional diagnostic approaches. Moreover, we have uncovered new genomic mechanisms of disease and genes associated with IBMFS leading to new areas of research into the underlying biology of these challenging diseases."

    "research_summary": "Nucleoside monophosphate kinases play crucial roles in biosynthesis and regeneration of nucleotides. Prokaryotic UMP kinase belongs to a family of amino acid kinases but not to other nucleoside monophosphate kinases. Although many structures of prokaryotic UMP kinase have been determined, limited structural information has been available on the conformational changes along the reaction and allosteric pathways. We determined the crystal structure of UMP kinase of an extreme thermophile Thermus thermophilus HB8 in ADP-UDP\u2013bound form at 2.6-\u00c5 resolution. The structure of the ADP-UDP complex is the first structure of bacterial UMP kinase with a phosphoryl group donor and an acceptor. Upon simultaneous binding of ADP and UDP, the loop near ADP moved toward the active site without global open-closed conformational changes, compared to the ligand-free and UDP-bound forms. Such a shift was not observed for archaeal UMP kinases but had some similarities to those in other amino acid kinase families of enzymes. Arginase is a manganese-dependent metalloenzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. The product L-ornithine is an important component which has wide applications in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industry. Enzymatic biosynthesis of L-ornithine is one of the effective methods in which arginase is used as a bio-catalyst. Here, we report the crystal structure of arginase from <i>Thermus thermophilus</i> (<i>Tt</i>Arginase) in three different crystal forms. All structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined at 2.0 \u00c5, 2.3 \u00c5 and 2.91 \u00c5 resolution respectively. <i>Tt</i>Arginase is compared with other structural homologs and the putative catalytic site residues were identified. To understand the thermophilic nature of <i>Tt</i>Arginase, the sequence and structural factors of <i>Tt</i>Arginase was compared with its mesophilic counterpart <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> arginase <i>(Bs</i>Arginase). To get insights on structural stability, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried for <i>Tt</i>Arginase and <i>Bs</i>Arginase at three different temperatures (300 K, 333 K and 353 K). The results indicate that <i>Tt</i>Arginase is comparatively more stable than <i>Bs</i>Arginase. MD simulations were carried out in the absence of the metal ions at the active site which revealed high plasticity of the active site. The results suggest that metal ions are critical not only for the catalytic function, but also required for the maintenance of the proper active site geometry. Since arginase can be employed for large-scale industrial production of L-ornithine, the structural details of thermophilic arginases such as <i>Tt</i>Arginase will be helpful to engineer the protein to optimize its enzymatic action in a variety of conditions.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma. Nucleoside monophosphate kinases play crucial roles in biosynthesis and regeneration of nucleotides. These are bi-substrate enzymes that catalyze reversible transfers of a phosphoryl group between ATP and nucleoside monophosphate. These enzymes are comprised of the CORE domain, the NMP-binding domain, and the LID domain. Large conformational rearrangement of the three domains occurs during the catalytic cycle. Although many structures of CMP kinase have been determined, only limited structural information has been available on the conformational changes along the reaction pathway. We determined five crystal structures of CMP kinase of Thermus thermophilus HB8 in ligand-free form and the CMP \"open\", CMP \"closed\", ADP-CDP-Gd3+-, and CDP-bound forms at resolutions of 1.7, 2.2, 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 \u00c5, respectively. The ligand-free form was in an open conformation, whereas the structures of the CMP \"closed\", ADP-CDP-Gd3+-, and CDP-bound forms were in a closed conformation, in which the shift of the NMP-binding domain and LID domain caused closure of the substrate-binding cleft. Interestingly, the CMP \"open\" form was in an open conformation even with CMP bound, implying intrinsic conformational fluctuation. The structure of the ADP-CDP complex is the first structure of CMP kinase with a phosphoryl group donor and an acceptor. Upon simultaneous binding of ADP and CDP, the side chains of several residues in the LID domain moved toward the nucleotides without global open-closed conformational changes compared to those in the CMP \"closed\" and CDP complexes. These global and local conformational changes may be crucial for the substrate recognition and catalysis. The terminal phosphate groups of ADP and CDP had similar geometry to those of two ADP in AMP kinase, suggesting common catalytic mechanisms to other nucleoside monophosphate kinases. Our findings are expected to contribute to detailed understanding of the reaction mechanism of CMP kinase."

    "research_summary": "Abstract An enzyme switch, termed \u201cSwitchbody\u201d, is developed by fusing an antibody with a fragment of a split enzyme for the precise regulation of enzyme activity in response to an antigen. A luciferase\u2010based Switchbody is engineered by fusing the NanoLuc luciferase fragment HiBiT to the N\u2010terminus of an antibody. The enzyme activity of the Switchbody increases upon the addition of an antigen in a dose\u2010dependent manner in the presence of the complementary fragment LgBiT and its substrate furimazine, demonstrating the potential of the luciferase\u2010based Switchbody as a biosensor. As its working principle, ELISA shows that the interaction between HiBiT and LgBiT is facilitated by antigen binding. Moreover, X\u2010ray crystallography and NMR reveal the heterogeneous trapped state of the HiBiT region and an increasing motility of HiBiT region upon antigen binding, respectively. MD simulations and luminescence measurements show that antigen disrupted the trapping of HiBiT in the antibody, enabling its release. By applying this \u201cTrap and Release\u201d principle to Protein M, an antibody\u2010binding protein, label\u2010free IgG antibodies are successfully converted into bioluminescent Switchbodies. This adaptable Switchbody platform has the potential to expand switching technology beyond luciferase to various other enzymes in the future. Despite accumulating evidence that protein dynamics is indispensable for understanding the structural basis of biological activities, it remains challenging to visualize the spatial description of the dynamics and to associate transient conformations with their molecular functions. We have developed a new NMR protein structure determination method for the inference of multistate conformations using multiple types of NMR data, including paramagnetic NMR and residual dipolar couplings, as well as conventional NOEs. Integration of these data in the structure calculation permits delineating accurate ensemble structures of biomacromolecules. Applying the method to yeast ubiquitin hydrolase 1, we find large dynamics of its N-terminus (gating lid) and crossover loop surrounding the active site for ubiquitin-recognition and proteolysis. The N-terminus (gating lid) moves into and out of the crossover loop, suggesting their underlying functional significance. Our results, including those from biochemical analysis, show that large motion surrounding the active site contributes strongly to the efficiency of the enzymatic activity."

    "research_summary": "NHMRC Centre for Research Excellence in Tuberculosis (www.tbcre.org.au) and New South Wales Health Prevention Research Support Program. Abstract In November 2024, a highly divergent BA.3-related SARS-CoV-2 lineage, designated BA.3.2, was detected in South Africa, marking the first appearance of a BA.3-derived lineage in over two years. Phylogenetic reconstruction places BA.3.2 on an extended branch descending from ancestral BA.3, with no intermediate genomes detected, consistent with a prolonged period of unsampled or isolated evolution. Molecular clock analyses indicate accelerated divergence characteristic of a saltation event, while phylogeographic and demographic analyses point to a southern African origin followed by multiple independent exportations and evidence of ongoing global transmission. Relative to ancestral BA.3, BA.3.2 harbours 39 amino acid substitutions in the spike glycoprotein, two N-terminal domain deletions (\u0394136\u2013147 and \u0394243\u2013244), a four-residue insertion (ins214:ASDT), and a large deletion spanning ORF7a, ORF7b, and ORF8. The co-occurrence of D405N and R408S implies epistasis between these sites, while reversions R493Q and H505Y likely enhance ACE2 binding and antibody escape. Extensive remodeling across the spike, including loss of the C15\u2013C136 disulfide bond and substitutions in the SD1 and SD2 domains, may influence spike stability, cleavage, and fusogenicity. The emergence and continued circulation of BA.3.2 underscores the ongoing potential for highly divergent SARS-CoV-2 variants to arise and spread globally. Despite its limited prevalence, the persistence of BA.3.2 alongside dominant lineages, together with evidence of more recent expansion, indicates that this lineage retains the potential to become of epidemiological concern under favourable conditions. Background Legionnaires\u2019 disease causes severe pneumonia. Outbreaks are infrequent in Australia, with cooling water systems (CWS) regulated to reduce risk. In summer 2024, a Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 (Lp1) outbreak was detected in visitors to the Sydney central business district (CBD). We investigated to identify cases and to control the source. Methods Case-patients were detected through routine laboratory notifications and classified as per surveillance case definitions. Case-patients were interviewed to determine symptoms, and environmental exposures 2\u201310 days prior to symptom onset. We mapped exposures sites and walking routes to identify areas for investigation. CWS in shared exposure areas were inspected and tested for Legionella. Historical results from routine CWS testing were reviewed. Genomic sequencing was performed on environmental and patient isolates. Clinician and public alerts were issued, and CBD building managers were reminded to maintain CWS. Results The investigation identified 15 legionellosis case-patients: two had Lp1 positive sputum cultures, 14 were hospitalised, and six required intensive care. All case-patients visited the CBD during the period 12\u201326 December 2023. Between 3\u201312 January 2024, testing was performed on 166 CWS across 118 CBD sites, and on three water fountains. Lp1 was cultured from one CWS. Genomic sequencing from five environmental and two clinical isolates showed a probable link. The positive CWS was decontaminated but continued to have Lp1 detected, possibly due to ongoing dust contamination, necessitating additional maintenance. Weeks later, a case-patient diagnosed in Europe, who had visited key exposure locations in the CBD during 21\u201323 December 2023, was epidemiologically linked to the outbreak; this took the total number of case-patients to 16. Conclusions Our investigation indicated that a contaminated CWS may have been the source of this outbreak, with contamination potentially precipitated by nearby construction. This emphasises the importance of strengthening Australian CWS regulations to reduce Lp1 outbreak risk, and of timely reporting under International Health Regulations to identify additional outbreak cases. Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global public health concern. In Australia, TB incidence is low but remains elevated among overseas-born individuals. This study investigates a TB cluster in a nonclinical hospital setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting transmission dynamics and the public health response. Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted using medical records and epidemiological contact tracing data within a tertiary hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Three screening rounds targeted office contacts in different air-conditioning zones. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to assess Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Results: Five secondary cases of TB disease were identified following exposure to the index case, a non-clinical hospital employee with cavitating pulmonary TB. Among 233 identified contacts, 117 completed screening. Initially screened high-risk contacts (n=31) had high rates of TB disease ("

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Neuromuscular diseases (NMDs) are rare, progressive conditions that require lifelong, multidisciplinary care. Advances in diagnosis and treatment have increased survival into adulthood, making the transition from paediatric to adult care a critical stage of its management. However, evidence suggests that transition practices remain inconsistent across Europe. This study aimed to map and evaluate the current transition practices for patients with NMDs across Europe. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted by the European Reference Network for Rare Neuromuscular Diseases (ERN EURO-NMD) to assess current transition practices across European healthcare providers (HCPs). Sixty-seven healthcare professionals from 20 countries participated. The survey explored training provision, transition structures, professional involvement, timing, psychosocial support, and perceived barriers. Both descriptive and thematic analyses were performed. Results Only 29.9% of respondents reported structured transition protocols, and fewer than one in five (17,9%) had received formal training in transition care. The age to initiate transition was reported for most centres at 17\u201318 years, even though most clinicians identified 15\u201316 years as the ideal starting point. Multidisciplinary collaboration was present in some centres but was inconsistently implemented. Barriers included insufficient staff, lack of funding, inadequate adult care services, and poor inter-team communication. Post-transfer feedback to paediatric teams was limited. Despite these challenges, 59.7% of respondents believed that ERN EURO-NMD could facilitate improvement in transition care. Conclusions Transition care for patients with NMDs in Europe remains fragmented and under-resourced. To ensure continuity and improve outcomes, structured, multidisciplinary transition models are needed. A European roadmap, coordinated by ERN EURO-NMD, could harmonise practices, support professional training, and guide policy development across member states. Abstract BACKGROUND Despite advances in brain tumour care, survival rates for the most severe tumours types have improved by only 10% since 1971. Studies show significant variation in outcomes both within and across health systems. To further explore equity of care in the context of the United Kingdom (UK) and identify key challenges, we reviewed national brain tumour treatment, care, and research services. METHODS We collected data from 22 neuro-oncology centres (covering 84% of the UK population) in 2020 and 2024, as part of the Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence, a UK-wide benchmarking and service improvement programme. Analyses were based on 168 data points spanning the patient pathway, drawn from detailed application forms and feedback from over 3,000 patients. RESULTS Key improvements in services from 2020\u20132024 included: launch of new precision medicine trials, increased peer review of radiotherapy cases (from 74% to 89% of relevant cases), and expanded access to molecular and genomic testing, with total molecular tests submitted increasing 128% (from 2,946 to 6,730), and centres submitting samples for whole genome sequencing rising from 4/22 to 15/22. Emerging challenges included rising delays in imaging, pathology, and oncological treatment. Centres with at least one patient waiting &amp;gt;42 days to begin radiotherapy increased from 7/22 (32%) in 2020 to 20/22 (91%) in 2024. In both years, gaps were noted in access to specialised rehabilitation, neurology, and neuropsychology services, while patient feedback demonstrated varying access to nurse specialists. Finally, although all centres had clinical trials open in both 2020 and 2024, access varied (2\u201317 open per centre in 2024), with centres reporting numerous barriers, particularly staffing shortages (77%, 17/22). CONCLUSIONS Data highlight both progress and persistent inequities in UK brain tumour services. Findings will support best practice sharing and targeted national efforts to address barriers to equitable care. Abstract Background Molecular neuropathology is evolving rapidly, driven by novel genomic technologies, national policies, and the urgent need for precision brain tumor care. Inequity in access to genomic testing highlighted in previous reports warrants further investigation. Methods We analyzed anonymized data from 21 United Kingdom (UK) neuro-oncology centers (covering an estimated 84% of the population) collected in 2021 and 2024 via the Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence for Adults program. We assessed trends in genomic testing (including methylation arrays, gene panels, whole genome sequencing [WGS]), tumor snap freezing, turnaround times (TATs), and auditing. Results From 2021 to 2024, total genomic tests submitted across the 21 centers increased 128% from 2946 to 6730, while glioma cases increased 18% (from 3159 to 3722). Methylation arrays, gene panels, and WGS samples submitted rose by 342%, 174%, and 291%, respectively"

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> Background: Psychiatric disorders represent a significant global health burden with complex etiologies involving both genetic and environmental factors. However, while the main effects of genetic and environmental factors are frequently studied, their interplay in shaping psychiatric disorder risk remains poorly understood. This study investigates the interaction between polygenic scores (PGS) as proxies for genetic risk and environmental factors in the risk of psychiatric disorders. Method: This study utilized the iPSYCH case-cohort sample (n = 141,265). Environmental factors, including region, urbanicity, parental socioeconomic status, parental age, parental psychiatric history and early-life exposures: autoimmune disease, brain injury, and central nervous system (CNS) infections, were obtained from Danish nationwide registers. Logistic regression was used to examine the effects of targeted disorder-specific PGSs, environmental factors and their interactions on psychiatric disorders. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and ancestral principal components to account for population stratification. Results: Both PGS and environmental factors were associated with psychiatric disorders. We found limited evidence of gene\u2013environment interactions across the investigated psychiatric disorders. Most interaction terms were small and not statistically significant, but a few remained significant. These included a smaller PGS association with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in Southern Denmark compared with the Capital Region, a reduced PGS association with bipolar disorder in the medium and lowest parental income groups compared with the highest income group, and a weaker PGS association with major depressive disorder in individuals with parental psychiatric history compared with those without such history. In contrast, a larger PGS association with schizophrenia was observed in the paternal age group 31\u201335 years compared with the 26\u201330 years reference group, and a stronger PGS association with anorexia nervosa in North Denmark compared with the Capital Region. Conclusion: Genetic liability for psychiatric disorders, captured through PGS, was associated with mental disorder risk across environmental contexts. Only a few gene\u2013environment interactions were significant, and these were modest and mental disorder-specific. Overall, the findings highlight the difficulty of detecting robust gene\u2013environment interactions and the need for studies of sufficient scale and statistical power to identify subtle gene\u2013environment effects and improve understanding of psychiatric disorder etiology. Importance Not all individuals who die by suicide have a history of nonfatal suicide attempt (SA); however, little is known about the extent to which the genetic and environmental etiologies of SA and suicide are shared or distinct. Objective To examine shared and distinct risk factors for SA and suicide, focusing on clinically diagnosed health conditions and genetic factors. Design, Setting, and Participants For health conditions, a nested case-control study was performed using data from the Danish registers. For genetic factors, a case-control analysis framework was used, with individual genotypes retrieved from the iPSYCH2015 dataset, which was nested within the entire Danish population. Individuals older than 10 years were included to minimize the risk of misclassification for SA and suicide. Data were analyzed from January 2024 to April 2025. Exposures Twenty-eight health conditions and 35 polygenic scores (PGSs) for complex traits. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcomes were SA, suicide, and cumulative SA burden. Associations between health conditions and the risk of SA and suicide were assessed using conditional logistic regression. PGSs for complex traits were calculated using LDpred2-auto, and their associations with SA and suicide were evaluated via logistic regression. To assess whether effect sizes differed significantly between SA and suicide, bayesian model-based classification and Cochran Q test were applied. Results A total of 81 713 cases of SA (50 512 [61.8%] female; mean [SD] age, 32.3 [14.9] years), with 408 490 age-matched controls (252 525 [61.8%] female; mean [SD] age, 32.3 [14.9] years), and 9362 cases of suicide (2360 [25.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.1 [14.6] years), along with 46 749 matched controls (11 796 [25.2%] female; mean [SD] age, 45.1 [14.6] years) who were alive at the date of the case\u2019s death, were included in the health conditions analysis. The PGS analysis included 8221 cases of SA (5944 [72.3%] female; mean [SD] age, 19.7 [4.4] years) and 225 cases of suicide (80 [35.6%] female; mean [SD] age, 24.6 [5.0] years). Chronic diseases (eg, dyslipidemia or hearing problems) showed stronger associations with SA, while severe conditions (eg, cancer) were more strongly associated with suicide. Suicide was influenced only by PGSs for mental disorders, whereas SA was asso"

    "research_summary": "Background Infections may increase the risk of age-related diseases such as dementia. Accelerated immunological ageing, measurable by telomere length (TL), may be a potential mechanism. However, the relationship between different infections and TL or telomere attrition remains unclear. This systematic review synthesises existing evidence on whether infections contribute to TL or telomere attrition and highlights research gaps to inform future studies. Objective To summarise the literature on associations between infections and telomere length or attrition. Methods We conducted comprehensive searches across six databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, Cochrane Library) from inception to 22 May 2025, using concepts of infections, TL, and study type. Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias (ROB) using the ROBINS-E tool. Meta-analysis was unfeasible due to heterogeneity, so a narrative synthesis was conducted. Studies were grouped by infection type, telomere measurement assay, cell type, and statistical approach. A GRADE assessment was performed to evaluate evidence quality. Results Our searches identified 10,349 studies, of which 73 met eligibility criteria. Most (59) were cross-sectional and most were published after 2000, with the earliest from 1996. Most studies were from the USA (17). HIV was the most frequently studied infection (35 studies), with 79% (excluding overlapping samples) reporting an association between HIV and reduced TL or increased telomere attrition. Findings for other infections, including herpesviruses and Human Papillomavirus were more variable. Variation in infection type, measurement assay, cell type, and statistical approach made cross-study comparisons challenging. Most studies had a high ROB, mainly due to unmeasured confounding. The GRADE assessment rated evidence quality as very low. Conclusions Our review highlights a potential link between HIV and TL and telomere attrition. More robust longitudinal studies with standardised measurements and better confounder control are needed, particularly for non-HIV infections. PROSPERO (ID:CRD42023444854) Telomere attrition is a biomarker of cellular aging, influenced by lifestyle and dietary exposures. The specific role of macronutrient composition, particularly polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), in telomere dynamics remains insufficiently explored. We hypothesized that higher intake of specific macronutrients, particularly PUFAs, would be positively associated with leukocyte telomere length (LTL). In this cross-sectional study of 143,553 UK Biobank participants aged 40-69 years, we examined associations between macronutrient intake and standardized LTL (z-LTL), measured as the log-transformed telomere repeat to single-copy gene ratio. Dietary intake was assessed using repeated 24-hour web-based dietary recalls. Multivariable linear regression models were used to estimate associations between macronutrients (% of total energy intake) and z-LTL, adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates. Effect estimates were translated into age-equivalent changes in LTL. Carbohydrate and total fat intake were positively associated with z-LTL, corresponding to age-related LTL differences of approximately 30-40 days. In energy substitution models, n - 3 PUFA intake showed a stronger positive association with z-LTL than other fats, with adherence to recommended intake associated with differences equivalent to over 2 years (P < .0001) of age-related telomere shortening, whereas no evidence of an association for MUFA was observed. Energy-adjusted fibre intake was associated with an age-related change of LTL equivalent to 1 year (P < .0001). These findings suggest that dietary composition, particularly n - 3 PUFA intake, may be linked with LTL in a manner consistent with healthier cellular aging. Further longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to confirm these associations and explore their implications for dietary guidance. Abstract Introduction Infections are linked to an increased risk of age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease and dementia. Accelerated immunological ageing, which can be measured by telomere length, could be a potential underlying mechanism. However, the extent to which different infections influence telomere length or its attrition is not fully understood. Clarifying these relationships could guide preventive strategies to reduce age-related disease risk. Methods We conducted a systematic review searching six major databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health, Cochrane Library) on 31 August 2023. Two reviewers independently screened and selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the ROBINS-E tool. High inter-study heterogeneity meant meta-analysis was not feasible, so we performed a narrative synthesis. Studies were categorised by infection type, telomere measurement method, cell type"

    "research_summary": "Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, this study identifies a selective loss of PRR4\u207aCST3\u207aWFDC2\u207b seromucous acinar cells and a rise in GZMK\u207aCD8\u207a T cells in Sj\u00f6gren's disease, revealing distinct immune-mediated epithelial remodeling and interferon-driven dysfunction across diverse clinical presentations. These findings uncover a novel sub-cytolytic effector mechanism by which GZMK\u207aCD8\u207a T cells impair mitochondrial integrity and activate innate immune signaling, linking epithelial injury to type I interferon responses and offering new therapeutic targets. The transcriptional activator ATOH1 is a master regulator of the development of mechanosensory hair-cells (HCs) in the ear. We report that the ATOH1 target gene Casz1 encodes a transcription factor that regulates the rate of outer HC (OHC) maturation by gene repression. Genetic deletion of Casz1 during (but not after) development of the mouse cochlea caused: hearing loss; abnormal organization of mechanosensory stereocilia bundles in OHCs; abnormally low F-actin density in OHC cuticular plates; progressive loss of OHCs; and mild morphological alterations in inner HCs. RNA sequencing revealed that Casz1 deletion delayed downregulation of genes expressed in immature OHCs, including the actin regulator-encoding gene Coro2a , and accelerated upregulation of genes expressed in mature OHCs. Coro2a knockdown restored the density of cuticular plate F-actin in Casz1 mutant OHCs. Our data indicate that CASZ1 regulates transcriptional and morphological maturation of OHCs, and that CASZ1 in maturing HCs is necessary for hearing. Phosphorylation of Smad3 is a critical mediator of TGF-\u03b2 signaling, which plays an important role in regulating innate immune responses. However, whether Smad3 activation can be regulated in innate immune cells in TGF-\u03b2-independent contexts remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Smad3 is activated through the phosphorylation of its C-terminal residues (pSmad3C) in murine and human macrophages in response to bacterial and viral ligands, and this activation is mediated by activin A in a TGF-\u03b2-independent manner. Specifically, infectious ligands, such as LPS, induced secretion of activin A through the transcription factor STAT5 in macrophages, and activin A signaling in turn activated pSmad3C. This activin A/Smad3 axis controlled mitochondrial ATP production and ATP conversion into adenosine by CD73 in macrophages, enforcing an antiinflammatory mechanism. Consequently, mice with a deletion of activin A receptor 1b specifically in macrophages (Acvr1bfl/fl-Lyz2cre) succumbed more to sepsis as a result of uncontrolled inflammation and exhibited exacerbated skin disease in a mouse model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis. Thus, we have revealed a previously unrecognized natural brake to inflammation in macrophages that occurs through the activation of Smad3 in an activin A-dependent manner. The stria vascularis (SV) is an essential component of the inner ear that regulates the ionic environment required for hearing. SV degeneration disrupts cochlear homeostasis, leading to irreversible hearing loss, yet a comprehensive understanding of the SV, and consequently therapeutic availability for SV degeneration, is lacking. We developed a whole-tissue explant model from neonatal and mature mice to create a platform for advancing SV research. We validated our model by demonstrating that the proliferative behavior of the SV <i>in vitro</i> mimics SV <i>in vivo</i>. We also provided evidence for pharmacological experimentation by investigating the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in SV proliferation. Finally, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing from <i>in vivo</i> neonatal and mature mouse SV and surrounding tissue and revealed key genes and pathways that may play a role in SV proliferation and maintenance. Together, our results contribute new insights into investigating biological solutions for SV-associated hearing loss."

The multitude of legal requirements for working with biodiversity specimens is challenging and time consuming for researchers and biodiversity research institutions, including universities, museums, governmental and private institutions managing natural science collections (e.g., biobanks, preserved and living collections). This challenge significantly increased with the adoption of national laws and processes on access to genetic resources and benefit-sharing developed by provider countries in response to the Convention on Biological Diversity, Nagoya Protocol, and other concerns. Legal requirements often include a complex sequence of requests to different national authorities, response times and fees. However, obtaining the necessary documents is only the first step. Legal documentation must be managed for the full life-cycle of biodiversity specimens. In 2016, the Global Genome Biodiversity Network (GGBN) released a data standard and controlled vocabularies for permits and loans. From 2019 to 2023, GGBN led a SYNTHESYS+ project task group to review and expand them. The main outcomes are two typologies contributing to some of the core elements from the GGBN vocabularies for permits and loans. Other elements of the GGBN metadata are not addressed. The Biodiversity Permit/Contract Typology and the Typology of Legal/Contractual Terms for Biodiversity Specimens (see Schiller et al. 2024b) can serve as internationally standardised classification systems for managing permit and contract documents, and promote an internationally understandable exchange of information on terms within such documents. Their application should enable people from various backgrounds to quickly recognise what documents and legal conditions (i.e., permissions, prohibitions, restrictions, obligations) apply to a given biodiversity specimen. Details were presented at the 2024 SPNHC-TDWG joint conference (Suppl. material 1). The Biodiversity Permit and Contract Typology classifies legal and contractual documents based on their purpose. It consists of seven document categ"

    "research_summary": "The purpose of this article is to reveal the features of handling a company\u2019s internal data in modern conditions to create, promote, and monetise products based on it. Research methodology. The study employs analysis, synthesis, generalisation, systematisation, and graphical representation methods to achieve the set goal. Scientific novelty. The scientific novelty lies in identifying key technological factors that stimulate data commercialisation, improving the approach to forming products based on a company\u2019s internal data, determining key data monetisation strategies, and basic and advanced capabilities for creating and delivering data-based products. Conclusions. In modern conditions, generative artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things contribute to increased data accessibility and the development of business models based on it. The article explores the concept of Data as a Product (DaaP), which provides a systematic approach to data management, focusing on data quality, usability, and meeting end-user needs. The study presents key data monetisation strategies and critical success factors, including creating industry standards, using insights from the customer base, and transforming organisational know-how into a product. The emphasis is on adapting the company\u2019s operational model, modernising data processing technologies, and developing employees\u2019 technical skills. The challenges associated with implementing DaaP are examined, and prospects for integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies into this process are outlined. The aggravation of political confrontation and economic competition between the world\u2019s leading powers has led to the destruction of established international relations, armed conflicts, the introduction of sanctions, financial instability, and restrictions on trade and cooperation in the technological sphere, which significantly increases the complexity of conducting both local and international business. Since geopolitical risk is a relatively new and serious challenge for companies, there is a problem of investigating its theoretical aspects and developing organisational and methodological approaches to managing it at the level of business entities. This paper was devoted to the investigation of the essence of geopolitical risk, approaches to its classification, assessment, and accounting in the financial and economic activities of enterprises. The authors\u2019 definition of geopolitical risk is formulated and its classification by forms of manifestation is proposed. A critical review of methodological approaches to quantitative and qualitative analysis of geopolitical risks was carried out. Analysis of the relationship between the levels of the geopolitical risk index and some macroeconomic indicators of Ukraine showed that the variation in the levels of gross external debt depends on the geopolitical risk index of Ukraine by 88%, the consumer price index \u2013 by 86%, direct investment from Ukraine \u2013 by 84%, direct investment in Ukraine \u2013 by 76%, the gross domestic product of Ukraine \u2013 by 90%, the official exchange rate of the UAH against the USD \u2013 by 98%. The obtained dependencies allow predicting the behaviour of economic entities depending on the dynamics of the level of geopolitical risk and developing appropriate response scenarios. Based on the recommendations of risk management experts on ensuring the functioning of enterprises in the context of geopolitical turbulence, a list of measures is proposed that companies should take to anticipate and properly consider changes in the geopolitical situation and effectively counteract the associated risks The article presents a comparative analysis of the transport infrastructure characteristics in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. It outlines the fundamental shortcomings and challenges in the development of domestic transport infrastructure before the war, highlighting their impact on the socioeconomic situation in Ukraine. The article further analyzes preliminary estimates regarding the damage inflicted on the transport infrastructure due to hostilities. In light of the these findings, the conclusion is drawn that the post-war reconstruction of Ukraine\u2019s transport infrastructure should adhere to key principles such as multimodality, flexibility, connectivity, sustainability, technology, inclusiveness, productivity, and value creation. The author recommends priority measures for restoring the road, rail, air, and water transport infrastructure, considering both current requirements and future trends. The article substantiates the possibility and necessity of involving international organizations and private businesses in the process of post-war reconstruction of Ukraine\u2019s transport infrastructure. General statement of the problem and its connection with important scientific or practical tasks.Transport infrastructure plays a crucial role in developing the country's economy.It is the basis for ensuring the"

    "research_summary": "Deep seabed mining has emerged as one of the most contested frontiers of contemporary international law. As terrestrial mineral resources face depletion and the global transition towards green technologies accelerates demand for critical minerals, attention has shifted to the ocean floor beyond national jurisdiction. This region, designated as \u201cthe Area\u201d under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), is governed by the principle of the Common Heritage of Mankind and administered by the International Seabed Authority (ISA). However, the move from exploration to exploitation has exposed serious legal, environmental, and ethical concerns. This paper examines the international legal framework regulating deep seabed mining, with particular emphasis on UNCLOS and the institutional role of the ISA. It critically analyses the adequacy of existing rules, environmental safeguards, and benefit-sharing mechanisms, and highlights regulatory gaps that threaten marine ecosystems and global equity. The study argues that without stronger precautionary standards, transparency, and accountability, deep seabed mining risks undermining both environmental protection and the normative foundations of international ocean governance. Keywords: Deep seabed mining, UNCLOS, International Seabed Authority, Common Heritage of Mankind, environmental law, global commons [This corrects the article DOI: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e22198.]. The present study aimed to assess the water quality of Man Sagar Lake using multivariate statistical techniques. Water samples were collected over two years (2021\u20132023) from four sampling sites, and ten critical physicochemical parameters, namely temperature, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), alkalinity, hardness, nitrate, and phosphate, were analyzed following APHA standard methods. To interpret the complex dataset, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Factor Analysis (FA), and Cluster Analysis (CA) were applied to identify major pollution sources, underlying factors, and site groupings. The results indicated relatively stable surface water temperatures (~26 \u00b0C), consistently alkaline pH (~8.95), and high EC (~2.38 mS/cm), while critically low DO (3.39\u20133.42 mg/L) reflected severe oxygen stress. Elevated BOD and COD, particularly at Site 1, signified heavy organic pollution, while nitrate (~4.2 mg/L) and phosphate (~1.19 mg/L) suggested eutrophication risk. PCA revealed a dominant pollution gradient accounting for 92.6% of total variance, mainly driven by organic and nutrient enrichment. FA extracted four latent factors linked to organic decomposition, chemical buffering, ion\u2013nutrient imbalance, and seasonal variability. CA classified the sites into two distinct clusters, separating highly polluted zones (Sites 1 and 3) from relatively cleaner areas (Sites 2 and 4). Correlation analysis showed DO positively correlated with alkalinity (r = 0.738), COD (r = 0.562), BOD (r = 0.514), and hardness (r = 0.555). COD was strongly related to BOD (r = 0.505) and alkalinity (r = 0.657). pH correlated positively with alkalinity (r = 0.504) and COD (r = 0.398), but negatively with phosphate (r = \u20130.156). Both DO and BOD were weakly but significantly negatively correlated with phosphate. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of multivariate statistical techniques in diagnosing pollution drivers and provides a comprehensive framework for water quality assessment and restoration of stressed urban lakes. ABSTRACT Introduction There is an ongoing debate about the neural mechanisms and subjective preferences involved in the processing of social rewards compared to non\u2010social reward types. Methods Using whole\u2010brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined brain activation patterns during the anticipation and consumption phases of monetary and social rewards (using the Monetary and Social Incentive Delay Task\u2014MSIDT, featuring human avatars) and their associations with self\u2010reported social reward preferences measured by the Social Reward Questionnaire (SRQ) in 20 healthy right\u2010handed individuals. Results In the anticipation phase, all reward types activated the dorsal striatum, middle cingulo\u2010insular (salience) network, inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and supplementary motor areas. The consumption phase primarily engaged posterior cortical areas. Higher preference for prosocial interactions (as assessed by SRQ) was associated with increased right posterior cingulate activity during monetary reward anticipation and enhanced activity in the left striatum and salience network activation during social reward anticipation. In the consumption phase, higher prosociality was associated with stronger activation in frontal regions, the dorsal striatum, and the thalamus for monetary rewards and stronger putamen activity for social rewards. Conclusions Individual differences in social reward preferences, particularly pro"

The hydroxycarboxylic acid family of receptors (ENSFM00500000271913, nomenclature as agreed by the NC-IUPHAR Subcommittee on Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptors [36, 12]) respond to organic acids, including the endogenous hydroxy carboxylic acids 3-hydroxy butyric acid and L-lactic acid, as well as the lipid lowering agents nicotinic acid (niacin), acipimox and acifran [53, 60, 65]. These receptors were provisionally described as nicotinic acid receptors, although nicotinic acid shows submicromolar potency at HCA2 receptors only and is unlikely to be the natural ligand [60, 65]. Neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are challenging to treat due to the biological complexity of the disease and the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Whole exome and genome sequencing studies have identified disease-linked rare variants in patients with large effect size. Here, we functionally characterize the schizophrenia linked variant V1282F in SCN2A, encoding the sodium channel Nav1.2. This variant was introduced into isogenic lines of hiPSCs using CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing tools. hiPSCs were then differentiated into cortical neurons to understand how the variant and gene may be contributing to disease. We observed a significant (~25%) decrease in sodium current in the V1282F neurons compared to control neurons, suggesting the mutation is causing a loss-of-channel function. These results were supported by recordings in recombinant cells overexpressing either the mutant or wildtype Nav1.2, with the mutant channel having significantly (~75%) lower current amplitude than wildtype. We hypothesize that this phenotype may contribute to disease either through the direct loss of neuronal activity or through subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment."

    "research_summary": "Importance Accessing mental health care is challenging for youths, especially those facing intersectional disadvantages, but whether enhancing youth services increases reach and timeliness has rarely been investigated. ACCESS Open Minds (ACCESS-OM) transformed services at urban, rural, and Indigenous sites in Canada using 5 principles (early identification, rapid access, appropriate care, no age-based transitions from 11-25 years, and youth and family engagement). Objective To evaluate whether the number of youths referred (hypothesis 1), offered evaluation appointments within 72 hours of referral (hypothesis 2), and receiving services within 30 days of the first appointment (hypothesis 3) increased over the course of ACCESS-OM\u2019s implementation. Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included youths (aged 11-25 years) at 11 sites referred between March 2016 and December 2020. Data were analyzed from April 2022 to April 2024. Exposure Existing primary and/or community services implemented ACCESS-OM\u2019s core components: broad-spectrum mental health services, outreach, youth-friendly walk-in spaces, open systems accepting referrals from multiple sources, and response-time benchmarks (72 hours to evaluation and 30 days to start treatment). Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were the referral rate and the probability of being offered a first evaluation within 72 hours and receiving services within 30 days. Dates of referral and/or help-seeking, first offered appointment, first evaluation, and first services received were recorded. Multilevel negative binomial regression was used for hypothesis 1, and time-to-event analyses followed by multilevel accelerated failure time (AFT) models were used for hypotheses 2 and 3. Results A total of 7889 youths were referred; 4519 (mean [SD] age, 19.3 [3.4] years; 2440 [54%] cisgender women; 1049 [23.21%] Indigenous; 991 [21.93%] Visible Minority [Arab, Black, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Latin American, South Asian, Southeast Asian, West Asian, other ethnicity, and multiple ethnicities]; and 1525 [49.10%] White) were evaluated before March 2020. Each 6-month progression after implementation was associated with a 10% increase in referral rates (IRR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13). The probability of being offered an initial appointment (\u03c7 2 2 = 20.30; P &amp;amp;lt; .001) and receiving services (\u03c7 2 2 = 4.48; P = .01) after any given delay differed significantly over the 3 years. In adjusted AFT models, each 6-month progression was associated with a 3% decrease in time to offered evaluation (time ratio [TR], 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.99) and first services (TR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.94-1.00). Moderate to severe mental health problems were associated with longer delays to offered first appointments (TR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.24) and services (TR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.01-1.22). Conclusions and Relevance As hypothesized, after ACCESS-OM implementation, more youths sought help, and the timeliness of initial response and services improved over time. These findings suggest that core principles, benchmarks, and implementation supports are valuable in organizing youth mental health care. Future efforts should make benefits equitable for those with severe problems. Abstract Background There exist few direct studies of delusional content in psychosis across geo-cultural contexts, especially those in which treatment protocols and measures are comparable. To directly examine an illness outcome that is potentially culturally mediated, this study investigated the baseline presentation and longitudinal trajectory of delusions in first-episode psychosis (FEP) across 2 similar treatment settings in Montr\u00e9al (Canada) and Chennai (India). Study Design Patients entering an early intervention program for FEP in Chennai (N = 168) and Montr\u00e9al (N = 165) were compared on site-level differences in the presentation of delusions across specific time points over 2 years of treatment. Delusions were measured using the Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms. Chi-square and regression analyses were conducted Study Results At baseline, delusions were more frequent in Montr\u00e9al than in Chennai (93% vs 80%, respectively; X2(1) = 12.36, P &amp;lt; .001). Thematically, delusions of grandiosity, religiosity, and mind reading were more common in Montr\u00e9al than in Chennai (all P &amp;lt; .001); however, these baseline differences did not persist over time. Regression revealed a significant time-by-site interaction in the longitudinal course of delusions, which differs from the trajectory of other FEP-positive symptom domains. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct comparison of delusions in similar programs for FEP across 2 different geo-cultural contexts. Our findings support the notion that delusion themes follow consistent ordinal patterns across continents. Future work is needed to unpack the differences in severity that present at baseline and minor differences in content. We have bee"

    "research_summary": "Our study found that LLIF was associated with minor long-term decreases in psoas size and quality on the surgical side, small mean bilateral strength losses, and no side-specific sensory deficits. Background: Spondylodiscitis is a growing infectious condition with significant morbidity. The impact of multifocal involvement remains understudied. This study compared 90-day all-cause readmission rates between patients with solitary versus multifocal spondylodiscitis and identified the associated risk factors. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the 2020 Nationwide Readmissions Database was conducted. Adult patients with primary spondylodiscitis were identified using ICD-10 codes and categorized into solitary or multifocal involvement groups. Demographic, clinical, and surgical data were extracted. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression were performed. Results: Of 6132 patients, 585 (9.6%) had multifocal disease. Multifocal patients were slightly younger (58.9 vs. 60.3 years; p = 0.049); had longer hospital stays (14.7 vs. 11.4 days; p &lt; 0.001), time to readmission (p &lt; 0.001); and surgery was more common (p = 0.003). Ninety-day readmission rates were similar (35.6% vs. 34.9%; p = 0.766). Type 2 diabetes was the only comorbidity significantly associated with multifocal disease (p = 0.020) and independently predicted readmission (aOR 1.236). Surgery and longer length of stay were protective (aOR 0.743; 0.0990). Conclusions: Multifocal spondylodiscitis is relatively common but not an independent risk factor for readmission. Readmission rates of both cohorts were similar. Surgery and prolonged hospitalization may reduce readmission risk. Cervical sagittal alignment has received a rapid and disproportionate increase in publications in the last ten years which may reflect increased interest in personalized surgery through deformity correction and motion preservation. Our study provides a graphic perspective on this topic and reflects the importance of spinal alignment in all sections of the spinal column."

    "research_summary": "Bio-oil obtained from biomass pyrolysis has emerged as an interesting alternative to replace fossil fuels. The aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of temperature (350 \u2013 520 \u00b0C) on the yield of products from the pyrolysis of powder obtained from dry branches of Euphorbia tirucalli, using a laboratory-scale rotating cylinder reactor. The biomass was treated and characterized to estimate CHNS contents, moisture, volatile materials, ash and carbon, lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose contents, FTIR, TG/DTG, XRD, XRF and SEM. The activation energy for biomass degradation was evaluated in the non-isothermal regime with heating rates of 5 and 10 \u00b0C/min, which had values between 232.92 and 392.84 kJ/mol. The results obtained showed biomass as a raw material with potential for biofuel production, as it had a high content of organic matter (78.3%) and fixed carbon (7.11%). The maximum bio-oil yield was obtained at a temperature of 450\u00b0C, with the following results: bio-oil content of 8.12%; char of 32.7%; non-condensed gas phase of 35.4%; losses of 23.8%; higher heating value of 3.43 MJ/kg; pH of 4.93; viscosity of 1.5 cP. The chromatographic analysis of the bio-oil produced under these conditions showed the presence of phenol (17.71%), methylcyclopentenone (10.56%) and dimethylcyclopentenone (7.76%). SARC-F, disease duration, and type-2 diabetes were independent predictors of recurrent falls. A history of falls, disease duration, and dysautonomia predicted falls. Confirmed sarcopenia did not predict falls or recurrent falls in this cohort. This work studies the stability of oil-in-water emulsions and proposes a new methodology to evaluate the impact of different emulsion's components (sodium chloride, surfactant, and oil) on permeability decline during the injection into natural rocks. Stable emulsions were obtained by varying surfactant and oil concentrations and stirring speed. Emulsions, proven to be stable for more than 24h, were used in coreflooding tests. First, coreflooding experiments were conducted by injecting brine, which provided a permeability reduction of 7% and 20% in rocks measuring approximately 20mD and 120mD, respectively. Then, a surfactant solution was injected, resulting in a decline in permeability from 17 to 23% in the studied scenarios. Finally, emulsions with 0.05 and 0.01wt% oil concentrations were injected, and permeability was reduced to around 65% of its original value in low permeability rocks. Results show that damage due to oil droplets retention was intensive in the scenarios studied. The immune system's inflammatory response is a crucial defense mechanism against infectious agents. At the onset of the pandemic, researchers primarily focused on the respiratory consequences of coronavirus, while overlooking the virus's impact on other organs, such as the brain. However, it is now apparent that post-covid sequelae can persist, especially in those who suffered severe forms of the disease. These symptoms include memory impairment, excessive fatigue, and mood swings. This study examines the possible link between the brain's inflammatory response and these prevalent sequelae, as well as strategies to improve the quality of life for those affected."

    "research_summary": "The BORG trend presents another challenge for harm reduction efforts focused on curbing excessive drinking in college students. The high intensity drinking of BORG use, paired with associated blackouts, vomiting, and behavioral disinhibition, render this phenomenon as living up to its name. Objectives: Adolescents with substance use disorder report high rates of tobacco use. Despite recommendations for counseling and pharmacotherapies for tobacco cessation among adolescents, their use remains low. The objective of this study was to characterize the availability of tobacco cessation counseling and pharmacotherapies, as well as smoking and vaping policies, in adolescent-serving substance use treatment facilities in the United States. Methods: The present study analyzed facility-reported data from the 2023 National Substance Use and Mental Health Services Survey. Substance use treatment facilities serving adolescents only (ages 11\u201321) were compared with those serving both adolescents and adults on tobacco use screening, availability of tobacco cessation education/counseling and pharmacotherapies (nicotine replacement therapy, bupropion, and varenicline), and smoking and vaping policies. Results: Most adolescent-only facilities offered tobacco use screening (82.6% vs 82.8% in adult/adolescent facilities) and education/counseling for tobacco cessation (71.9% vs 70.0% in adult/adolescent facilities). Adolescent-only facilities were more likely than adult/adolescent facilities to prohibit onsite smoking (84.7% vs 33.1%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) or vaping (87.7% vs 41.9%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001), yet less likely to offer tobacco cessation pharmacotherapies to patients (20.7% vs 45.5%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: While most adolescent-only substance use treatment facilities offered tobacco cessation education or counseling and restricted tobacco use at their sites, they were less likely than adult/adolescent facilities to offer pharmacotherapy for tobacco cessation. This reflects a missed opportunity to offer robust options to treat tobacco use among adolescents with substance use disorders. Purpose: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) approved for type 2 diabetes and overweight or obesity may affect alcohol drinking behavior. The present prospective observational study investigated hazardous alcohol drinking in patients at the University of Chicago Weight Loss Clinic. They received GLP-1 RA therapy and underwent body weight and hazardous drinking assessments before and during treatment. Methods: Fourteen patients were prescribed a GLP-1 RA for overweight or obesity (liraglutide [n=1], semaglutide [n=8], and tirzepatide [n=5]), along with standard care dietary counseling and physical activity recommendations. All but one patient met the body mass index (BMI) cutoff for obesity in the United States (n=13, BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ; n=1, BMI=29.50 kg/m 2 ). Patients screened positive for hazardous drinking on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT; score \u22658) and were categorized into subgroups of high (score 8\u201314) and very high AUDIT (score \u226515). The AUDIT was readministered on average 9.6 (\u00b14.8) months after medication initiation. Results: There were significant reductions in BMI and AUDIT scores over time, with patients in the very high AUDIT group reporting more pronounced reductions in AUDIT scores compared with those in the high AUDIT group. Effect sizes were large, indicating a high magnitude of the effect of GLP-1 RA medications on reducing hazardous drinking scores. Conclusions: These findings support the association between GLP-1 RA treatment and reduced alcohol consumption, particularly for individuals with very hazardous alcohol drinking levels. A better understanding of the acute mechanisms underlying GLP-1 RA therapies and randomized clinical trials may aid in the development of pharmacotherapies for hazardous drinking beyond patients with diabetes and/or obesity."

    "research_summary": "Sleep is a fundamental physiological process crucial for maintaining cognitive function, emotional regulation, and overall brain health. Recent research has highlighted sleep\u2019s pivotal role in facilitating the brain\u2019s intrinsic cleansing mechanisms, primarily via the glymphatic system, which actively removes metabolic waste products, including neurotoxic proteins such as beta-amyloid and tau. Disruptions in sleep architecture or duration can impair these clearance processes, potentially contributing to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms underlying sleep-dependent brain cleansing, examining the interplay between neuronal activity, cerebrospinal fluid dynamics, and circadian regulation. It also explores the implications of sleep deprivation, aging, and pathological conditions on brain homeostasis. By integrating molecular, neurophysiological, and clinical findings, this article underscores the importance of sleep in maintaining cerebral health and highlights potential therapeutic strategies to optimize sleep for neuroprotection. We develop single-atom In on MoB<sub>2</sub> (In<sub>1</sub>-MoB<sub>2</sub>) as an efficient catalyst for urea synthesis from coelectrolysis of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>. Mechanistic studies reveal a three-site synergistic catalysis mechanism of In<sub>1</sub>-MoB<sub>2</sub>, where In<sub>1</sub>/B sites enable the formation of *CO/*NH<sub>2</sub> intermediates and their C-N coupling, while the Mo site facilitates H<sub>2</sub>O dissociation to provide the ample protons required for the protonation of C/N intermediates toward urea generation. Moreover, by employing a plasma-electrocatalytic route with integrating plasma-driven air oxidation and electrocatalysis, In<sub>1</sub>-MoB<sub>2</sub> exhibits the exceptional Faradaic efficiency of 80.4% and urea yield rate of 116.5 mmol h<sup>-1</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>, ranking in the top performance level. Abstract Single-cell long-read concatemer sequencing (scNanoHi-C) technology provides unique insights into the higher-order chromatin structure across the genome in individual cells, crucial for understanding 3D genome organization. However, the lack of specialized analytical tools for scNanoHi-C data impedes progress, as existing methods, which primarily focus on scHi-C technologies, do not fully address the specific challenges of scNanoHi-C, such as sparsity, cell-specific variability, and complex chromatin interaction networks. Here, we introduce DeepNanoHi-C, a novel deep learning framework specifically designed for scNanoHi-C data, which leverages a multistep autoencoder and a Sparse Gated Mixture of Experts (SGMoE) to accurately predict chromatin interactions by imputing sparse contact maps, thereby capturing cell-specific structural features. DeepNanoHi-C effectively captures complex global chromatin contact patterns through the multistep autoencoder and dynamically selects the most appropriate expert from a pool of experts based on distinct chromatin contact patterns. Furthermore, DeepNanoHi-C integrates multiscale predictions through a dual-channel prediction net, refining complex interaction information and facilitating comprehensive downstream analyses of chromatin architecture. Experimental validation shows that DeepNanoHi-C outperforms existing methods in distinguishing cell types and demonstrates robust performance in data imputation tasks. Additionally, the framework identifies single-cell 3D genome features, such as cell-specific topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries, further confirming its ability to accurately model chromatin interactions. Beyond single-cell analysis, DeepNanoHi-C also uncovers conserved genomic structures across species, providing insights into the evolutionary conservation of chromatin organization. Abstract Single\u2010cell Hi\u2010C (scHi\u2010C) has provided unprecedented insights into the heterogeneity of 3D genome organization. However, its sparse and noisy nature poses challenges for computational analyses, such as chromatin architectural feature identification. Here, scCAFE is introduced, which is a deep learning model for the multi\u2010scale detection of architectural features at the single\u2010cell level. scCAFE provides a unified framework for annotating chromatin loops, TAD\u2010like domains (TLDs), and compartments across individual cells. This model outperforms previous scHi\u2010C loop calling methods and delivers accurate predictions of TLDs and compartments that are biologically consistent with previous studies. The resulting single\u2010cell annotations also offer a measure to characterize the heterogeneity of different levels of architectural features across cell types. This heterogeneity is then leveraged to identify a series of marker loop anchors, demontrating the potential of the 3D genome data to annotate cell identities without the aid of simultaneously sequenced omics data. Overall, scCAFE not only serves "

    "research_summary": "Abstract Purpose This retrospective cohort study investigated the efficacy of a sublingual sufentanil tablet system (SSTS) in comparison to intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) with piritramide for the management of postoperative pain following lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of patients undergoing single- or two-level lumbar spinal fusion surgery and receiving the SSTS or IV-PCA for postoperative pain relief as part of multimodal pain management that included IV paracetamol and oral metamizole. The following variables were collected: postoperative pain intensity and frequency scores using the numerical rating scale (NRS), hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), occurrence of nausea, postoperative mobilization, and patient satisfaction (MacNab criteria). Results Sixty-four patients were included. Those receiving the SSTS ( n = 30) had significantly lower pain intensities on the operative day (NRS: 4.0, CI: 3.6\u20134.3 vs. 4.5, CI: 4.2\u20134.9; p &lt; 0.05) and one day postoperatively (NRS: 3.4, CI: 3.1\u20133.8 vs. 3.9 CI: 3.6\u20134.3; p &lt; 0.05) compared to patients receiving IV-PCA ( n = 34). No differences were observed on postoperative days 2 to 5. SSTS patients experienced more nausea than IV-PCA patients ( p = 0.027). Moreover, SSTS patients had a higher percentage of early mobilization following surgery than IV-PCA patients ( p = 0.040). Regarding patient satisfaction, no significant differences were seen between the groups. Conclusion The SSTS is a potentially advantageous alternative to opioid IV-PCA for use within a multimodal approach to managing postoperative pain after lumbar fusion surgery. Furthermore, the potentially higher emetic effect of SSTS should be considered, and the patient should be able to perform the application. Our low-dose protocol with less tube voltage and lower electric current leads to less radiation exposure with the same safety and efficiency. In conclusion, every facility that performs CT-based procedures should check whether a further dose reduction is applicable to avoid stochastic radiation damage to the patient. Abstract Purpose To present the first known pediatric utilization of cone-beam navigation system (CBNS) for hemivertebra resection and spondylodesis Case presentation A 14-year-old female with congenital scoliosis, diagnosed at 8 years of age, presenting with progressive symptoms, a Cobb angle (L3-5) of 38\u00b0 at time of surgery, treated historically with conservative measures. Presence of spinal intramedullary disease was excluded prior to operation via whole spine MRI. Results Patient successfully underwent surgical correction utilizing the CBNS (O-arm\u2122, Medtronic\u00ae). Post-operative Cobb angle (L3-5) was restored to 8\u00b0. Following four different pediatric patient\u2019s radiation exposures (two receiving correction via the O-arm platform and two via the traditional method employing fluoroscopy), we show a reduction in radiation exposure using the CBNS system. Conclusion We present the first known pediatric case of the utilization of the CBNS system for hemivertebra correction. We demonstrate that utilizing the CBNS platform can not only increase surgical accuracy but also decrease pediatric patient\u2019s radiation exposure as a preoperative CT scan is not needed. Future studies should continue to explore additional benefits of implementing the system into surgical practice."

    "research_summary": "Attention is a fundamental aspect of cognition. Previous research has identified and examined alerting, orienting, and executive \u201cattention networks\u201d, mainly through computerised behavioural tasks and neural measurements. Improved virtual reality (VR) headsets now offer new means to assess attention networks. Initial results that we obtained with a VR-adapted version of the well-established Attention Network Test-Revised (ANT-R) already indicated overall comparability of computerised and VR testing environments. In the current study, we utilised the flexibility and high degree of experimental control provided by mobile VR headsets to investigate attention network interactions and the effects of ecologically more valid stimuli and response feedback. In a single experimental session, 44 participants performed the computerised ANT-R and the ANT-VR. Response times were generally longer for the ANT-VR but the overall result pattern confirmed the similarity between test variants for network scores and interactions. Some notable differences were observed as well. Results obtained with the ANT-VR point towards increased engagement and show reduced costs for disengaging attention from an invalid cue, faster moving and engaging, and shorter orienting time. A validity effect was only observed with the ANT-R, whereas a previously reported location conflict was not observed with both variants. Participants also rated their VR experience and confirmed good overall headset utilisation. These findings establish the ANT-VR as a new flexible and mobile testing environment for controlled attention assessment and research outside the traditional laboratory or clinical settings. Humans are adept at integrating auditory and visual information to improve intelligibility, which can improve neural tracking of the speech envelope. Speech-relevant tactile information also improves tracking yet effects on intelligibility are mixed, possibly because we are not regularly exposed to speech-relevant tactile information. Here, we used a short-term audio-tactile training protocol to fundamentally advance understanding of audio-tactile integration capabilities during speech perception. Data from 64 younger adult participants (aged 18-29) were collected over five EEG sessions. Participants completed a speech-in-noise task, with audio-tactile and audio-only stimuli. Participants then received training with either tactile information that was congruent with sentences heard (trained group) or incongruent (pseudo-trained group). After three training sessions, participants completed the speech-in-noise task again in a fourth session. Measures of neural speech-envelope tracking were recorded. Two weeks later, participants returned for a follow-up session. Results indicated a significant effect of session (pre- or post-training) on speech intelligibility, but no significant effect of group (trained, or pseudo-trained) or stimulus (audio-only, or audio-tactile). At baseline, there was a significant increase in speech-envelope tracking accuracy with audio-tactile stimuli relative to audio-only, suggesting more accurate neural representation during perception of audio-tactile stimuli. After training, there was no benefit of congruent training to audio-tactile tracking, but there was an enhancement of audio-only speech-envelope tracking following incongruent training. This suggests that speech intelligibility and tracking of audio-tactile speech are not enhanced by short-term audio-tactile training. This work challenges prevailing assumptions by demonstrating a lack of support for the assumed link between tracking and intelligibility. These data provide critical evidence that will inform future innovation of speech understanding in technology. Abstract Speaking involves the orchestration of multiple speech muscles while actively monitoring sensory consequences through auditory and somatosensory feedback. A mistuned sensorimotor mechanism may disrupt the normal integration of motor and auditory brain systems in several developmental and acquired motor speech disorders, including stuttering, speech apraxia, speech sound disorders and dysarthria. Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive measure of online neural activity with potential to assess (deficiencies in) sensorimotor integration during speech production. However, the relation between EEG and continuous speechoutput remains poorly characterized. Here, we investigate prediction of auditory speech output using multivariate EEG patterns under three levels of auditory masking. A decoding analysis was employed in combination with a lag-based approach that allowed studying predictions based on instantaneous EEG-speech relations, and their involvement in feedforward and feedback processes. For all masking conditions, we found consistent decoding in instantaneous lags and speech feedback lags, but not in feedforward lags. Furthermore, the level of auditory masking modulated decoding in both the "

    "research_summary": "The discrepancy in the distribution of source and target domains is usually referred to as a domain shift. It is one of the reasons for the inferior performance of machine learning solutions at deployment. We illustrate that the domain shift issue is pertinent to the readings of the vehicles\u2019 operational sensors. This is due to the fact that these measurements are collected over a period of time and are susceptible to various changes that happen in the meantime. Examples of these changes are usage pattern variations, aging of the vehicles, seasonal shifts, and driver changes. However, domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) have shown promising results to reduce the negative impact of the domain shift. The present study investigates domain adaptation (DA) in the predictive maintenance field by estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbochargers. The devices are operating on a fleet of VOLVO trucks, and the information about their services is collected over four years between 2016 and 2019. The input features to the model are a set of bi-weekly collected measurements called logged vehicle data (LVD). The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we propose a new approach for detecting domain (covariate) shift using an autoencoder. Second, we adapt domain adversarial neural networks to the specific application of predicting turbocharger failures. Finally, we deploy a recurrent feature extraction layer in the DANN architecture to incorporate temporal aspect of the data. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the traditional approach. Introduction: Studies have repeatedly stated the importance of individual differences in the problem of emotion recognition. The primary focus of this study is to predict Heart Rate Variability (HRV) changes due to affective stimuli from the individual characteristics. These features include age (A), gender (G), linguality (L), and sleep (S). In addition, the best combination of individual variables was explored to estimate emotional HRV. Methods: To this end, HRV indices of 47 college students exposed to images with four emotional categories of happiness, sadness, fear, and relaxation were analyzed. Then, a novel predictive model was introduced based on the regression equation. Results: The results show that different emotional situations provoke the importance of different individual variable combinations. The best variables arrangements to predict HRV changes due to emotional provocations are LS, GL, GA, ALS, and GALS. However, these combinations were changed according to each subject separately. Conclusion: The suggested simple model effectively offers new insight into emotion studies regarding subject characteristics and autonomic parameters. Background : This study offers a robust framework for the classification of autonomic signals into five affective states during the picture viewing. To this end, the following emotion categories studied: five classes of the arousal-valence plane (5C), three classes of arousal (3A), and three categories of valence (3V). For the first time, the linguality information also incorporated into the recognition procedure. Precisely, the main objective of this paper was to present a fundamental approach for evaluating and classifying the emotions of monolingual and bilingual college students. Methods : Utilizing the nonlinear dynamics, the recurrence quantification measures of the wavelet coefficients extracted. To optimize the feature space, different feature selection approaches, including generalized discriminant analysis (GDA), principal component analysis (PCA), kernel PCA, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), were examined. Finally, considering linguality information, the classification was performed using a probabilistic neural network (PNN). Results : Using LDA and the PNN, the highest recognition rates of 95.51%, 95.7%, and 95.98% were attained for the 5C, 3A, and 3V, respectively. Considering the linguality information, a further improvement of the classification rates accomplished. Conclusion : The proposed methodology can provide a valuable tool for discriminating affective states in practical applications within the area of human-computer interfaces."

    "research_summary": "Nanophthalmos is a rare congenital ocular disorder characterized by the reduction of both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye, occurring without associated ocular malformations. This condition predisposes individuals to secondary angle-closure glaucoma, a leading cause of vision loss. Due to the rarity of nanophthalmos, current research is limited, primarily focusing on its clinical classification, genetic underpinnings, and complications. This review synthesizes existing literature on the pathogenesis, epidemiology, ocular parameter changes related to glaucoma, and surgical interventions for secondary glaucoma in nanophthalmic patients, emphasizing studies from the past five years to enhance understanding in clinical research and management. ABSTRACT To develop and validate a multimodal machine learning model for opportunistic osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women using dental periapical radiographs. This retrospective multicenter study analyzed 3885 periapical radiographs paired with DEXA\u2010derived T \u2010scores from postmenopausal women. Clinical, handcrafted radiomic, and deep features were extracted, resulting in a fused feature set. Radiomic features ( n = 215) followed Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI) guidelines, and deep features ( n = 128) were derived from a novel attention\u2010based autoencoder. Feature harmonization used ComBat adjustment; reliability was ensured by intra\u2010class correlation coefficient (ICC) filtering (ICC \u2265 0.80). Dimensionality was reduced via Pearson correlation and LASSO regression. Four classifiers\u2014logistic regression, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and XGBoost\u2014were trained and evaluated across stratified training, internal, and external test sets. A logistic regression model was selected for clinical translation and nomogram development. Decision curve analysis assessed clinical utility. XGBoost achieved the highest classification performance using the fused feature set, with an internal AUC of 94.6% and external AUC of 93.7%. Logistic regression maintained strong performance (external AUC = 91.3%) and facilitated nomogram construction. Deep and radiomic features independently outperformed clinical\u2010only models, confirming their predictive strength. SHAP analysis identified DEXA T \u2010score, age, vitamin D, and selected radiomic/deep features as key contributors. Calibration curves and Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow test ( p = 0.492) confirmed model reliability. Decision curve analysis showed meaningful net clinical benefit across decision thresholds. Dental periapical radiographs can be leveraged for accurate, non\u2010invasive osteoporosis screening in postmenopausal women. The proposed model demonstrates high accuracy, generalizability, and interpretability, offering a scalable solution for integration into dental practice. <b>Objective:</b> To investigate the treatment approaches for attacking eyes in patients with clinical acute primary angle-closure glaucoma (APACG) and their alignment with the recommendations in the <i>Chinese Glaucoma Guidelines (2020)</i>. <b>Methods:</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted, including medical records of consecutive inpatients diagnosed with APACG from 22 ophthalmic centers nationwide during three periods: September 7, 2020, to January 6, 2021; September 7, 2021, to January 6, 2022; and September 7, 2022, to January 6, 2023. For patients meeting the inclusion criteria in both eyes, the right eye was uniformly selected for analysis. Demographic characteristics, medical history, and ocular examination data were collected. Patients were categorized into medication group, laser treatment group, and surgical treatment group based on their final treatment after admission. The proportion of different treatment approaches and their consistency with the <i>Chinese Glaucoma Guidelines (2020)</i> were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed using the chi-square test. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2 567 patients (2 567 eyes) with APACG were included, with a mean age of (66.7\u00b19.3) years. Among them, 615 (24.0%) were male and 1 952 (76.0%) were female; 1 431 eyes (55.7%) were right eyes and 1 136 eyes (44.3%) were left eyes. There were 83 eyes (3.2%) in the medication group, 256 eyes (10.0%) in the laser treatment group, and 2 228 eyes (86.8%) in the surgical treatment group. In the surgical treatment group, 1 951 eyes (87.6%) underwent cataract extraction, and 1, 300 eyes (58.3%) received phacoemulsification combined with goniosynechialysis as the preferred surgical approach. The rate of complete consistency between the treatment regimens and the recommendations in the <i>Chinese Glaucoma Guidelines (2020)</i> was 52.4% (1 344/2 567), and the rate of partial consistency was 40.3% (1 035/2 567). <b>Conclusions:</b> Phacoemulsification combined with goniosynechialysis has become the mainstream surgical approach for treating attacking eyes in APACG patients in China. Over 90% of APACG patients received treatment consistent with the <i"

    "research_summary": "Monitoring (currently invasive) of cerebral venous blood oxygenation is a key to avoiding hypoxia-induced brain injury resulting in death or severe disability. Noninvasive, optoacoustic monitoring of cerebral venous blood oxygenation can potentially replace existing invasive methods. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time noninvasive monitoring of cerebral venous blood oxygenation through intact scalp that was validated with invasive, \"gold standard\" measurements. We performed an in vivo study in the sheep superior sagittal sinus (SSS), a large midline cerebral vein, using our novel, multi-wavelength optoacoustic system. The study results demonstrated that: 1) the optoacoustic signal from the sheep SSS is detectable through the thick, intact scalp and skull; 2) the SSS signal amplitude correlated well with wavelength and actual SSS blood oxygenation measured invasively using SSS catheterization, blood sampling, and measurement with \"gold standard\" CO-Oximeter; 3) the optoacoustically predicted oxygenation strongly correlated with that measured with the CO-Oximeter. Our results indicate that monitoring of cerebral venous blood oxygenation may be performed in humans noninvasively and accurately through the intact scalp using optoacoustic systems because the sheep scalp and skull thickness is comparable to that of humans whereas the sheep SSS is much smaller than that of humans. There is strong clinical evidence that controlling cerebral venous oxygenation (oxyhemoglobin saturation) is critically important for patients with severe traumatic brain injury as well as for patients undergoing cardiac surgery. However, the only available method for cerebral venous blood oxygenation monitoring is invasive and requires catheterization of the internal jugular vein. We designed and built a novel optoacoustic monitor of cerebral venous oxygenation as measured in the superior sagittal sinus (SSS), the large midline cerebral vein. To the best of our knowledge, optical monitoring of cerebral venous blood oxygenation through overlying extracerebral blood is reported for the first time in this paper. The system was capable of detecting SSS signals in vivo at 700, 800, and 1064 nm through the thick (5-6 mm) sheep skull containing the circulating blood. The high (submillimeter) in-depth resolution of the system provided identification of the SSS peaks in the optoacoustic signals. The SSS peak amplitude closely followed the actual SSS blood oxygenation measured invasively using catheterization, blood sampling, and \"gold standard\" CO-Oximetry. Our data indicate the system may provide accurate measurement of the SSS blood oxygenation in patients with extracerebral blood over the SSS. Noninvasive monitoring of cerebral blood oxygenation with an optoacoustic technique offers advantages over current invasive and noninvasive methods. We report the results of in vivo studies in the sheep superior sagittal sinus (SSS), a large central cerebral vein. We changed blood oxygenation by increasing and decreasing the inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO(2)). Optoacoustic measurements from the SSS were performed at wavelengths of 700, 800, and 1064 nm using an optical parametric oscillator as a source of pulsed near-infrared light. Actual oxygenation of SSS blood was measured with a CO-Oximeter in blood samples drawn from the SSS through a small craniotomy. The amplitude of the optoacoustic signal induced in the SSS blood at lambda = 1064 nm closely followed the changes in blood oxygenation, at lambda = 800 nm was almost constant, and at lambda = 700 nm was changing in the opposite direction, all in accordance with the absorption spectra of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin. The optoacoustically predicted oxygenation correlated well with actual blood oxygenation in sheep SSS (R(2) = 0.965 to 0.990). The accuracy was excellent, with a mean difference of 4.8% to 9.3% and a standard deviation of 2.8% to 4.2%. To the best of our knowledge, this paper reports for the first time accurate measurements of cerebral venous blood oxygenation validated against the \"gold standard\" CO-Oximetry method. A noninvasive optoacoustic technique could be a clinically useful alternative to existing, invasive methods for cerebral oxygenation monitoring. Recently we proposed to use an optoacoustic technique for monitoring cerebral blood oxygenation by probing large cerebral and neck veins including the superior sagittal sinus and the internal jugular vein. In these studies we used a multi-wavelength optoacoustic system with a nanosecond optical parametric oscillator as a light source and a custom-made optoacoustic probe for the measurement of the optoacoustic signals in vivo from the area of the sheep neck overlying the external jugular vein, which is similar in diameter and depth to the human internal jugular vein. Optoacoustic signals induced in venous blood were measured with high resolution despite the presence of a thick layer of tissues (up to 10 mm) betwe"

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> Background GLI family zinc finger 3 (GLI3) is a transcription factor involved in limb development. <italic>GLI3</italic> gene variants have been shown to be associated with several human congenital limb malformations, including Greig's head polydactyly and syndactyly, Pallister\u2013Hall syndrome, non-syndromic postaxial polydactyly (PAP-A/B), and preaxial polydactyly type IV (PPD IV). The aim of this study was to identify <italic>GLI3</italic> gene variants in ten Chinese families with limb malformations. Methods Ten Chinese families with limb malformations were recruited. Variant screening in probands was then performed using next generation sequencing, with candidate pathogenic variants verified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) combined with Sanger DNA sequencing. Variant pathogenicity was evaluated using bioinformatics, evolutional conservation, and disease and mutant allele co-segregation approaches. The biological effects of missense variants were predicted by three-dimensional protein conformation analysis. Results Ten different <italic>GLI3</italic> variants were identified, including two missense variants: c.1063G &gt; A (p.Val355Ile) and c.1489C &gt; A (p.Leu497Ile), four nonsense variants: c.2374C &gt; T (p.Arg792*), c.2008C &gt; T (p.Gln670*), c.1096 C &gt; T(p.Arg366*), and c.2029C &gt; T(p.Gln677*), three small deletions: c.600delC (p.Tyr200*), c.1880_1881del(p.His627Argfs*48), and c.811_812delCT(p.Leu271Serfs*5), and a large gross deletion g.42061081_42069739. Seven of these ten variants were not recorded in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD). Conclusions Ten <italic>GLI3</italic> variants were successfully identified in families with different limb malformations, and indicate clinical and allelic <italic>GLI3</italic> heterogeneity-related limb malformations. This work expands the <italic>GLI3</italic> gene-variant landscape and associated clinical disease manifestations, and provides solid evidence for genetic counseling and prenatal gene diagnostics in affected families. Neuroblastoma (NB), a common infantile neuroendocrine tumor, presents a substantial therapeutic challenge when MYCN is amplified. Given that the protein structure of N-Myc is disordered, we utilized Alphafold for prediction and GROMACS for optimization of the N-Myc structure, thereby improving the reliability of the predicted structure. The publicly available datasets GSE49710 and GSE73517 were adopted, which contain the transcriptome data of clinical samples from 598 NB patients. Through various machine learning algorithms, FAM13A was identified as a characteristic gene of MYCN. Cell functional experiments, including those on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle, also indicate that FAM13A is a potential risk factor. Additionally, Alphafold and GROMACS were employed to predict and optimize the structure of FAM13A. Protein-protein docking and molecular dynamic modeling techniques were then used to validate the enhanced protein stability resulting from the interaction between N-Myc and FAM13A. Consequently, targeting FAM13A holds the potential to reduce the stability of N-Myc, hinder the proliferation of NB cells, and increase the infiltration of immune cells. This multi-faceted approach effectively combats tumor cells, making FAM13A a prospective therapeutic target for MYCN-amplified NB. Objective: To compare the clinical efficacy of Endobutton-looped steel plate and clavicular hook steel plate in the treatment of acromioclavicular joint dislocation. Method: The retrospective case-control study was conducted at the Baoding Forensic Hospital, Hebei University, China and comprised data from January 2022 to June 2023 of adult inpatients of either gender with acromioclavicular joint dislocation. The data was divided into intervention group A and control group B. Group A patients had been treated with Endobutton-looped steel plate, while those in group B had been treated using clavicular hook steel plate. Clinical efficacy, clinical indicators, Karlsson score for shoulder joint function, range of motion of the shoulder, and complications during 6-month follow-up were compared between the groups. Data was analysed using SPSS 26. Results: Of the 50 patients, there were 25(50%) in group A; 15(60%) males and 10(40%) females with mean age 37.75\u00b16.24 years (range: 19-58 years) and mean dislocation-to-visit time 2.52\u00b10.61 days (range: 0-7 days). There were 25(50%) patients in group B; 16(64%) males and 9(36%) females with mean age 38.24\u00b16.30 years (range: 18-59 years) and mean dislocation-to-visit time 2.47\u00b10.58 days (range: 0-6 days). The groups showed no significant differences (p&gt;0.05). Clinical efficacy of group A was higher than that of group B (p&lt;0.05). Group A showed shorter surgical duration and incisional length, and lower average treatment cost compared to group B(p&lt;0.05). The shoulder joint function in group A was significantly better than group B (p&lt;0.05). Post-treatment, the r"

    "research_summary": "Although anxiety is not considered a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it adds a significant and distinct layer of complexity. While not included in the diagnostic criteria, anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, are highly prevalent among individuals with ASD. Many exhibit clinically elevated levels of anxiety, which can exacerbate social, cognitive, and emotional challenges. Individuals with heightened anxiety are more prone to sustained negative emotional states, potentially reflecting dysfunction in brain systems involved in emotion regulation. Anxiety is widely understood to have a neurobiological basis, and extensive research has examined how its arousal influences behavioral development, particularly in neurotypical populations. This paper explores the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of anxiety within the context of ASD, with a focus on the amygdala, a structure heavily implicated in both anxiety and autism. We review the role of the prefrontal cortex in modulating amygdala function, and how atypical connectivity between these regions may contribute to the manifestation of anxiety symptoms in individuals with ASD. Understanding genetics and environmental influences in autism has been explored in greater depth in the past decades. However, the mechanism by which they converge that lead to autism still needs to be explored further. An autism diagnosis in DSM-5 results from a neurodevelopmental disorder having an adverse effect on normal brain function, affecting communication and social interaction combined with restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. This paper reviews current work investigating how the underlying mechanism of the brain structure and function relate to the complex and aberrant behavioral manifestations of autism. Mapping this connection can provide us with a better understanding of the autism signs and symptoms, obtaining the process of accurate diagnosis more straightforward. As a complex neurobehavioral condition, autistic individuals process the environment and their interactions with others differently from those without autism. So, they make different perceptions and connections between themselves and the environment. Consequently, they will have difficulty communicating, forming relationships, and responding appropriately to their environment. It is due to this lifelong neurobehavioral dysfunction that prevents autistic individuals from adequately understanding what they perceive and the emotional expression of others. There will be differences in their mental states, how their brain works, and how their thinking processes will be affected by a neurodevelopmental disability. Consciousness is the ability to have intentionality, which is a process that operates at various temporal scales. To qualify as conscious, an artificial device must express functionality capable of solving the Intrinsicality problem, where experienceable form or syntax gives rise to understanding 'meaning' as a noncontextual dynamic prior to language. This is suggestive of replacing the Hard Problem of consciousness to build conscious artificial intelligence (AI). Developing model emulations and exploring fundamental mechanisms of how machines understand meaning is central to the development of minimally conscious AI. It has been shown by Alemdar and colleagues [New insights into holonomic brain theory: implications for active consciousness. Journal of Multiscale Neuroscience 2(2023), 159-168] that a framework for advancing artificial systems through understanding uncertainty derived from negentropic action to create intentional systems entails quantum-thermal fluctuations through informational channels instead of recognizing (cf., introspection) sensory cues through perceptual channels. Improving communication in conscious AI requires both software and hardware implementation. The software can be developed through the brain-machine interface of multiscale temporal processing, while hardware implementation can be done by creating energy flow using dipole-like hydrogen ion (proton) interactions in an artificial 'wetwire' protonic filament. Machine understanding can be achieved through memristors implemented in the protonic 'wetwire' filament embedded in a real-world device. This report presents a blueprint for the process, but it does not cover the algorithms or engineering aspects, which need to be conceptualized before minimally conscious AI can become operational. We define precognitive affect, composed of information holding dispositional states, as noncontextual, rudimentary building blocks of subjective intentionality.We take on a psychodynamic approach to intentional agency.Intentions unfold into actions in animate thermodynamics reducing subjective uncertainty by negentropic action.They are intentions in action carrying meaning in species having complex protein interactions with various regulated gene sets.In particular, the unfolding of intenti"

    "research_summary": "Social animals, like rodents, are able to recognize and differentiate between the identity of familiar individuals. Recognizing the identity of familiar individuals is important for developing social structures such as hierarchy, kinship, and family. However, mechanisms underlying the recognition of social identity remain unclear. Most rodent studies of social recognition are based on the propensity of rodents to interact with a novel social target, a phenomenon known as social novelty. However, behavioral tasks for examining social novelty cannot reveal the recognition of familiar conspecifics based on their identities. Presented here are behavioral tasks allowing for the examination of identity recognition in C57BL/6 mice by associating two familiar mice with or without a valenced experience. Subjects had interactions with two mice either without (neutral) or with a valenced experience (negative or positive) and became familiar with these mice. The negatively valenced mouse was associated with shocks, while the positively valenced mouse was associated with a food reward. Following training, the recognition of the identity of these familiar mice can be revealed in a social discrimination test, which is represented as the preference for the positively valenced mouse and avoidance of the negatively valenced mouse compared to the neutral mouse. Behavioral tasks for identity recognition could be useful in probing social memory mechanisms and the pathophysiology of disorders with impaired social cognition, such as autism spectrum disorder or schizophrenia. Abstract Background The susceptibility to chronic stress has been associated with depression, a mood disorder which highly implicates the hippocampus. Hippocampal contribution to stress susceptibility has been supported by findings in mice following chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). However, little is known of the role of hippocampal activity in determining the development of stress susceptibility. Methods We used the UCLA miniscope to longitudinally measure the activity of dorsal CA1 hippocampal neurons across CSDS. Apart from examining the representation of social information by these neurons, we also compared social memory in mice that were susceptible or resilient to CSDS. Results We observed more stable dCA1 correlates of social interaction and social memory in CSDS resilience. Such changes were absent in CSDS susceptible mice and accompanied by greater social memory impairments. Conclusions CSDS susceptibility may be supported by hippocampal social cognitive processes, reflected in diminished hippocampal representations of social information and a greater impairment in social memory. As a crucial player in excitatory synaptic transmission, AMPA receptors (AMPARs) contribute to the formation, regulation, and expression of social behaviors. AMPAR modifications have been associated with naturalistic social behaviors, such as aggression, sociability, and social memory, but are also noted in brain diseases featuring impaired social behavior. Understanding the role of AMPARs in social behaviors is timely to reveal therapeutic targets for treating social impairment in disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. In this review, we will discuss the contribution of the molecular composition, function, and plasticity of AMPARs to social behaviors. The impact of targeting AMPARs in treating brain disorders will also be discussed."

    "research_summary": "Neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia are challenging to treat due to the biological complexity of the disease and the lack of knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology. Whole exome and genome sequencing studies have identified disease-linked rare variants in patients with large effect size. Here, we functionally characterize the schizophrenia linked variant V1282F in SCN2A, encoding the sodium channel Nav1.2. This variant was introduced into isogenic lines of hiPSCs using CRISPR/CAS9 genome editing tools. hiPSCs were then differentiated into cortical neurons to understand how the variant and gene may be contributing to disease. We observed a significant (~25%) decrease in sodium current in the V1282F neurons compared to control neurons, suggesting the mutation is causing a loss-of-channel function. These results were supported by recordings in recombinant cells overexpressing either the mutant or wildtype Nav1.2, with the mutant channel having significantly (~75%) lower current amplitude than wildtype. We hypothesize that this phenotype may contribute to disease either through the direct loss of neuronal activity or through subsequent abnormal neurodevelopment. Abstract The transcription factor GATA4 is broadly expressed in nascent foregut endoderm. As development progresses, GATA4 is lost in the domain giving rise to the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and forestomach (FS), while it is maintained in the domain giving rise to the simple columnar epithelium of the hindstomach (HS). Differential GATA4 expression within these domains coincides with the onset of distinct tissue morphogenetic events, suggesting a role for GATA4 in diversifying foregut endoderm into discrete esophageal/FS and HS tissues. By eliminating GATA4 in the developing HS or maintaining GATA4 in the developing FS, we identified GATA4 as an essential, principal regulator of simple columnar epithelium morphogenesis within the developing HS. GATA4- deficient HS epithelium adopted FS-like fate, and conversely, GATA4- expressing FS epithelium adopted HS-like fate. Underlying structural changes in these epithelia were broad changes in gene expression networks attributable to GATA4 directly activating or repressing expression of HS or FS defining transcripts. Our data implicate GATA4 as having a primary role in suppressing an esophageal/FS transcription factor network during HS development to promote a columnar epithelium. Moreover, GATA4-dependent phenotypes in developmental mutants reflected changes associated with Barrett\u2019s esophagus, suggesting that developmental biology can provide insight into human disease mechanisms. In the mammalian genome, the clustered protocadherin (cPCDH) locus provides a paradigm for stochastic gene expression with the potential to generate a unique cPCDH combination in every neuron. Here we report a chromatin-based mechanism that emerges during the transition from the naive to the primed states of cell pluripotency and reduces, by orders of magnitude, the combinatorial potential in the human cPCDH locus. This mechanism selectively increases the frequency of stochastic selection of a small subset of cPCDH genes after neuronal differentiation in monolayers, 10-month-old cortical organoids and engrafted cells in the spinal cords of rats. Signs of these frequent selections can be observed in the brain throughout fetal development and disappear after birth, except in conditions of delayed maturation such as Down's syndrome. We therefore propose that a pattern of limited cPCDH-gene expression diversity is maintained while human neurons still retain fetal-like levels of maturation."

    "research_summary": "With the growth of neuroscience research, new neuroscience and society (NeuroX) fields like neuroethics, neurolaw, neuroarchitecture, neuroeconomics, and many more have emerged. In this article we report on lessons learned about mentoring students in the interdisciplinary space of neuroscience and society. We draw on our experiences with the recently launched Dana Foundation Career Network in Neuroscience & Society. This resource supports educators and practitioners mentoring students aiming to apply neuroscience in diverse fields beyond medicine and biomedical science. Through our programming, we identified three key lessons: (1) students are interested in exploring a wide range of neuroscience and society intersections; (2) outreach to underserved institutions generates avenues for students to join NeuroX conversations; and (3) by offering free access to online NeuroX resources and a network of subject-matter experts, the Career Network joins many partners helping to bridge the gap between neuroscience and society."

    "research_summary": "Consciousness arises from physical and geometric constraints, yet the nature of phenomenality remains unresolved. A conceptual and mechanistic framework links self-intending projection to phenomenal consciousness. Based on Dynamic Organicity Theory, this materialist framework posits that quantum effects underlie phenomenality. Moving beyond representational models, Embedded Quantum Physicalism (EQP) offers a multiscale, non-reductive approach in which consciousness is naturalized through effective processes embedded within the brain\u2019s functional geometry. This geometry evolves through functional interactions that constrain internal states, while its curvature organizes agential holons and intrinsic information into self-referential loops, enabling intentional closure via self-intending projections. Reflexivity alone is insufficient; intrinsic intentionality emerges from these loops and provides the necessary condition for consciousness. Under EQP, phenomenality is not an ontological primitive but a physically instantiated phenomenon. Unlike reductive accounts that reduce consciousness to neural correlates or dismiss it as epiphenomenal, EQP traces phenomenality to thermo-quantum fluctuations in the brain\u2019s biochemistry, which reshape functional geometry. This geometry supports effective processes, including projections, holonomies, and projective closure. Toroidal-like neuropil microcavities enter coherent quasipolaritonic modes through quantum-optical effects, involving delocalized information systems that transform intrinsic information. Phenomenality arises when stable agential holons form self-intending projections with projective closure, embodied in a Weyl-like, non-Euclidean functional geometry shaped by effective quantum potentials acting as lensing mechanisms at small scales in the neuropil. This paper presents a theoretical model proposing that quasiparticle-mediated proton (H+) dynamics, modulated by dipolar excitations across \u03c0-conjugated organic molecules, specifically at amphipathic membrane proteins and interfaces, give rise to emergent hybrid modes\u2014termed tripartite quasipolaritons\u2014under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. These modes arise from light-matter-vibration coupling dynamics. Quasiparticle-mediated proton dynamics within the hydrophobic pockets of amphipathic complexes occur through their non-closure under nonequilibrium steady-state conditions. We explore how quantum optical effects facilitate light-matter interactions, enhancing photoprotection, involving vibrational modes when anti-entropic conditions prevail for delocalized \u03c0-excitations while maintaining conserved epistemic quantum entropy. Dipolar excitations through patterns of energetic uncertainties play a role in establishing the conditions needed for a unified and interconnected informational system of photon pathways in aromatic amino acid residues. This system is proposed to link localized biochemical processes involving \u03c0-H+ interactions and \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking of amino acids in neuroproteins with the coupling dynamics that give rise to quantum optical effects. Quantum-delocalized information systems, involving the interplay between \u03c0-electron dynamics, localized electromagnetic fields, and proton interactions, create a quantum bridge between quantum optical effects and quantum memory. This may provide pathways through which intrinsic quantum phenomena, such as quantum memory, directly contribute to consciousness by enabling the action selection mechanism in quantum-delocalized systems. Our model proposes that such systems may underlie consciousness, supported by the quantum architecture of the multiscale brain. This framework uncovers a previously hidden mechanism for the interconnectedness of informational pathways between amino acids in proteins and among neural protein networks within and across neuropil microcavities, revealing a quantum foundation for functional unity. A new approach attempts to express the poststructural dynamics of the entropic brain in terms of the \u2018hidden\u2019 structure of uncertainties. By incorporating poststructural dynamics into our understanding of the physical, we can more clearly grasp how consciousness operates within a functional system approach that appropriately considers changeable boundary conditions through functional interactions. The causality is sought in boundary conditions when uncertainty reduction becomes an act of understanding as a course of action that navigates the multiscale landscape of potentialities. Motion through the multiscale landscape continuously changes uncertainties into intentionalities via \u2018multiscale redundancy.\u2019 In the multiscale version of the entropic brain, the \u2018hidden\u2019 structure of uncertainties unfolding through the poststructural dynamics occurring at different locations, levels, and times that instantly actualize through intermittent interactions as precognitive experienceabilities and combine into a global resonance before returning to spontaneous p"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Problem Physicians are playing a growing role as clinician\u2013innovators. Academic physicians are well positioned to contribute to the medical device innovation process, yet few medical school curricula provide students opportunities to learn the conceptual framework for clinical needs finding, needs screening, concept generation and iterative prototyping, and intellectual property management. This framework supports innovation and encourages the development of valuable interdisciplinary communication skills and collaborative learning strategies. Approach Our university offers a novel 3-year-long medical student Longitudinal Interdisciplinary Elective in Biodesign (MSLIEB) that teaches medical device innovation in 4 stages: (1) seminars and small-group work, (2) shared clinical experiences for needs finding, (3) concept generation and product development by serving as consultants for biomedical engineering capstone projects, and (4) reflection and mentorship. The MSLIEB objectives are to: create a longitudinal interdisciplinary peer mentorship relationship between undergraduate biomedical engineering students and medical students, and encourage codevelopment of professional identities in relation to medical device innovation. Outcomes The MSLIEB enrolled 5 entering cohorts from 2017 to 2021 with a total of 37 medical student participants. The first full entering cohort of 12 medical students produced 8 mentored biomedical engineering capstone projects, 7 of which were based on clinical needs statements derived from earlier in the elective. Medical student participants have coauthored poster and oral presentations; contributed to projects that won WolfieTank, a university-wide competition modeled after the television show Shark Tank; and participated in the filing of provisional patents. Students reflecting on the course reported a change in their attitude towards existing medical problems, felt better-equipped to collaboratively design solutions for clinical needs, and considered a potential career path in device design. Next Steps The MSLIEB will be scaled up by recruiting additional faculty, broadening clinical opportunities to include the outpatient setting, and increasing medical student access to rapid prototyping equipment. Major theories of consciousness predict that complex electroencephalographic (EEG) activity is required for consciousness, yet it is not clear how such activity arises in the corticothalamic system. The thalamus is well-known to control cortical excitability via interlaminar projections, but whether thalamic input is needed for complexity is not known. We hypothesized that the thalamus facilitates complex activity by adjusting synaptic connectivity, thereby increasing the availability of different configurations of cortical neurons (cortical \"states\"), as well as the probability of state transitions. To test this hypothesis, we characterized EEG activity from prefrontal cortex (PFC) in traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients with and without injuries to thalamocortical projections, measured with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that injury to thalamic projections (especially from the mediodorsal thalamus) was strongly associated with unconsciousness and delta-band EEG activity. Using advanced signal processing techniques, we found that lack of thalamic input led to 1.) attractor dynamics for cortical networks with a tendency to visit the same states, 2.) a reduced repertoire of possible states, and 3.) high predictability of transitions between states. These results imply that complex PFC activity associated with consciousness depends on thalamic input. Our model implies that restoration of cortical connectivity is a critical function of the thalamus after brain injury. We draw a critical connection between thalamic input and complex cortical activity associated with consciousness. Objective: The goals of our study: (1) the utility of orexin as a marker of coma recovery, (2) the correlation between orexin and recovery at 7 and 14 days, (3) correlation of orexin and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) over time, and (4) the correlation between CSF and serum orexin. Background: Coma is a serious complication that currently has no good biological markers. The hypothalamus plays an important function in consciousness circuity. Orexin A/B, a neuropeptide produced in the hypothalamus has an excitatory effect on multiple target areas in the brain. Previous orexin studies showed a decrease or absence in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in post cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke and comatose states Design/Methods: A prospective, IRB approved study with a target n= 20 with a diagnosis of coma due to stroke, including hemorrhagic, and TBI, treated in the Neuro Critical Care Unit at Stony Brook University Hospital. CSF was collected from an external ventricular drain (EVD) and corresponding blood serum samples on Days 0, 7, and 14. There was no modification to the clinical treatmen"

    "research_summary": "Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE) is characterised by sterile vegetations on heart valves and often emerges in hypercoagulable states like malignancy. It is frequently underdiagnosed and only comes to light during postmortem examination. Early diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulation can help lower mortality. We present a case of a woman in her 60s with marantic endocarditis, secondary to ovarian malignancy. She presented with a 4 week history of headache, confusion and abdominal discomfort. Examination revealed cyanosis, splinter haemorrhages and abdominal tenderness. Echocardiogram showed impaired left ventricular function and suspicion of a small vegetation at the tip of the anterior mitral valve. Further investigation revealed multiple cerebellar infarcts, pulmonary embolism, splenic infarct, ascites and a pelvic mass. A biopsy of the pelvic mass and analysis of ascitic fluid was consistent with high-grade serous carcinoma of tubo-ovarian origin. Following discussion at the gynaecology multidisciplinary team meeting, she was scheduled for chemotherapy treatment. Abstract Background Clinical neuroscience training programmes are becoming increasingly competitive to enter. UK university neuroscience societies act as a local environment for students to develop their career interests and provide portfolio building opportunities through hosting events such as annual conferences. Recently there has been a transition to more of these events being held online yet the impact of this, if any, remains unclear. This prospective study aimed to identify the impact of student-led neuroscience conferences on delegates and examine attitudes towards an online delivery approach. Methods Multi-centre prospective survey study using pre-conference, post-conference, and 6-month post-conference online questionnaires distributed at 6 virtual student-led neuroscience conferences in 2021. The questionnaires had five-domains: demographics, career aspirations, academic skillsets, an educational manipulation check (EMC) and mode of delivery preference. Results 924 surveys were completed across 559 conference attendances. 79.5% of delegates were medical students. Interest in a neuroscience career (p &lt; 0.001), preparedness to undertake research (p &lt; 0.001) and presentation (p &lt; 0.001), and EMC scores (p &lt; 0.001) increased immediately post conference and were retained at 6 months. Most participants at 6 months post-attendance had completed an academic project (71.9%) or presentation (50.9%). Online format was preferred (65%) with reasons including elimination of travel and access to home facilities whilst lack of face-to-face interaction and engagement were recognised limitations. Conclusion UK student-led online neuroscience conferences play a role in developing knowledge, academic skillsets and career interest as well as inspiring and facilitating future portfolio building. A hybrid virtual and in-person experience would offer an ideal solution to future conferencing, providing options promoting engagement and interactivity whilst advocating sustainability, accessibility and widening participation. Abstract Background COVID-19 has disrupted medical education in the United Kingdom (UK). The pandemic may result in a long-term disproportionate negative impact to students applying to Medical School from a low-socioeconomic background. In addition, the upsurge in Medical School applications increases the likelihood of stricter University entry criteria over the coming years. There is no current research to determine how widening participation of Medicine to students from low-socioeconomic backgrounds can be improved virtually. The aim of this study is to establish the impact of COVID-19 on students enrolled in UK widening access schemes and the role of virtual student led initiatives in widening participation. Methods A voluntary online survey was distributed to UK Sixth Form students ( N = 31) enrolled in a widening access scheme who attended Sheffield Neuroscience Society International Virtual Conference in February 2021. The event was free to attend. The five-domain survey consisted of questions determining demographics, career aspirations, impact of COVID-19, academic skillsets and an educational manipulation check. Results There were 30 pre-conference and 26 post-conference responses. 76.7 % had work experience cancelled due to COVID-19. A total of 36.7 % of participants reported participating in virtual work experience. \u2018Observe GP\u2019 and \u2018Medic Mentor\u2019 were each specified as attended virtual opportunities in 20 % of answers. Post conference, students felt significantly more confident in applying to Medical School ( p = 0.008) and more prepared to undertake a presentation ( p = 0.002). Educational manipulation check scores increased significantly ( p = 0.003). 100 % of students felt inspired to do further CV building activities. Conclusions COVID-19 has negatively impacted pupils enrolled in UK Medical School"

    "research_summary": "Background: Analyses from the Stenting and Aggressive Medical management for prevention of Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial showed that good control of vascular risk factors (systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein, and exercise) was associated with fewer vascular events and exercise had the biggest impact on the outcome. We sought to determine the type and duration of exercise performed by SAMMPRIS patients during the trial. Methods: SAMMPRIS aggressive medical management included a telephonic lifestyle modification program, INTERVENT, that was provided free of charge to all subjects during the study. We analyzed self-reported data collected by INTERVENT on the patients\u2019 type and duration of exercise from baseline (n=394) to 3 years (n=132). We calculated the mean duration for each exercise type at each time period and then compared the change in exercise duration from baseline using paired t tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Results: Walking was the most common form of exercise at all time points, as measured by both the duration of exercise and the number of patients performing the exercise. The mean duration of walking and other aerobic activities increased significantly from baseline to all other time points. Conclusions: The type of self-reported exercise performed by SAMMPRIS patients included mostly walking or other aerobic activity and increased significantly during follow-up. Downloaded by 34.237. Background and Purpose: The goals of telestroke programs are to provide safe and efficient stroke care to hospitals. An important marker of efficient acute stroke care delivery is door-to-needle (DTN) time, the time it takes from entrance into the emergency department to administration of alteplase. We sought to determine if DTN time was improving over time within our statewide telestroke network. Methods: From 5/4/2008-7/12/2015, we prospectively collected data on DTN time from consultations performed in our 18-hospital statewide telestroke network. DTN time was recorded on 765 of the 4985 consults where alteplase recommendations were documented. For all active hospital sites combined, the yearly mean DTN time was determined and compared by year with a one-way ANOVA and Tukey test. Results: Of the total 6116 consults performed over the time period, there was an average of 95.5 total consults/year among all 18 sites and an average of 8.3 consults/active site/year. The mean +/- SD DTN for all of the consults in all years was 85.4+/-42.0. As shown in the Figure, we found a significant decrease in DTN over time at (p&lt;0.001). In the post-hoc test, the following pairs were determined to be significantly different (at p&lt;0.05): 2008 vs. 2015; 2009 vs. 2013, 2014, and 2015; 2010 vs. 2013, 2014, and 2015; 2011 vs. 2013, 2014, and 2015; 2012 vs. 2013, 2014, and 2015. Conclusions: Among a statewide Telestroke network, the mean DTN time continued to decrease over the last 7 years, reflecting more efficient delivery of acute stroke treatment. Since more efficient stroke care delivery is associated with better outcomes, this may be a contributing factor to the overall improved stroke mortality within the state. Background: Previous analyses of SAMMPRIS trial data showed that good risk factor control resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of vascular events (stroke, MI, and vascular death), with exercise as the most important predictor of good outcome. We sought to determine the type and duration of exercise that SAMMPRIS patients reported during the trial. Methods: In SAMMPRIS, 451 patients with recent TIA or stroke attributed to 70-99% intracranial stenosis were randomized to aggressive medical management (AMM) alone or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting plus AMM at 50 USA sites. AMM included a telephonic lifestyle modification program, INTERVENT, that was provided free of charge to all subjects during their participation in the study. We analyzed self-reported data collected by INTERVENT on the patients\u2019 type and duration of exercise from baseline (n= 394) to 4 years (n=34). We calculated the mean duration for each exercise type at each time period and then compared the change in exercise duration from baseline using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Results: Data from subjects who completed the INTERVENT questionnaires were included in these analyses. As shown in the Figure, walking was the most common form of exercise at all time points, as measured by both the duration of exercise and the number of patients performing the exercise. The mean duration of walking and other aerobic activities increased significantly from baseline to all other time points. Conclusions: The type of self-reported exercise performed by SAMMPRIS patients included mostly walking or other aerobic activity and increased significantly during follow-up. Given that exercise was protective against recurrent vascular events, future secondary prevention stroke trial"

    "research_summary": "Objective: This study aimed to describe the cognitive status, autonomy, quality of life, and social participation of individuals who had experienced a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) at least 10 years prior. Method: Data were collected from 29 individuals with moderate to severe TBI, with a mean age of 49 at the assessment time. Interviews were conducted approximately 22 years after the onset of the brain injury (mean age at onset was 27 years). Participants were divided into two groups based on the time elapsed since the TBI. Participants were asked about changes in their difficulties with age. Results: The study revealed that half of the participants perceived a decline in their cognitive abilities. Autonomy in activities of daily living deteriorated more than basic autonomy. Quality of life appeared to improve with age. Furthermore, there was a correlation between social participation and overall cognitive ability. No differences were found between the participant groups, suggesting that the time elapsed since the TBI did not seem to influence their progression. Conclusion: These findings underscore the evolution of the abilities of individuals with TBI several years after the initial incident, emphasizing the importance of long-term follow-up to tailor support throughout the individual\u2019s lifespan. The study also demonstrates substantial variability in developmental profiles. Additionally, social participation emerges as a pivotal factor to consider, potentially mitigating cognitive decline as individual\u2019s age. R\u00e9sum\u00e9 Chaque ann\u00e9e, 150 000 nouveaux cas de traumatismes cranio-c\u00e9r\u00e9braux (TCC) sont recens\u00e9s en France. Les TCC repr\u00e9sentent une cause majeure de handicap chez les sujets jeunes. De nombreuses \u00e9tudes se sont int\u00e9ress\u00e9es aux cons\u00e9quences d'un TCC durant les premiers mois, en mettant en \u00e9vidence des difficult\u00e9s somatiques et cognitivo-comportementales qui impactent la vie sociale, affective et professionnelle des personnes victimes. Selon la s\u00e9v\u00e9rit\u00e9 du TCC, ces difficult\u00e9s peuvent, totalement ou en partie seulement, r\u00e9gresser durant les premiers mois et jusqu'\u00e0 deux ans apr\u00e8s le TCC. L'\u00e9volution puis la consolidation des s\u00e9quelles cognitivo-comportementales peuvent se poursuivre jusqu'\u00e0 cinq ans apr\u00e8s le TCC. Peu d'\u00e9tudes ont port\u00e9 sur l'\u00e9volution des s\u00e9quelles cognitivo-comportementales avec l'avanc\u00e9e en \u00e2ge des personnes victimes d'un TCC. Celle-ci semble \u00eatre influenc\u00e9e par des facteurs sp\u00e9cifiques comme l'\u00e2ge de survenue du TCC, le sexe, \u00eatre porteur du g\u00e8ne ApoE4 mais \u00e9galement des facteurs environnementaux comme, la qualit\u00e9 des interactions cognitives et sociales. Abstract Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) result in cognitive and behavioral impairment inducing a disability in daily life for the TBI victims, but also for the families in social, professional and emotional domains. Evolution of these consequences has been widely described during the first few months after TBI (up two years after the TBI), but few studies are carried on the becoming of these impairments when TBI subjects are growing old. Evolution seems to be affected by endogenous factors such as gender, age, and ApoE4, and exogenous factors such as social interactions. Some studies suggest that TBI is a risk factor to develop a neurodegenerative disease. National audience"

    "research_summary": "Background: Information about individual\u2019s abilities in specific developmental domains captures the variability characteristic of Down syndrome (DS). Two commonly used measures which assess domain-specific skills of development are the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-3rd Edition (VABS). In DS, previous work found a positive association and moderate agreement between overall composite scores of these two measures. No study has explored domain-level agreement between the MSEL and VABS in children with DS.Aims: This exploratory study examined the concurrent validity between two sources of information measuring child development at the domain-level, parent report (VABS) and direct assessment (MSEL). Methods and Procedures: Twenty-three young children with DS (14 males; 13-48 months) completed the MSEL, which was administered by a trained examiner. Parents completed the VABS phone interview. Overlapping domains include receptive and expressive language and fine and gross motor skills. Outcomes and Results: Findings revealed no significant difference in the average age equivalent (AE) score when comparing the MSEL and VABS by domain. There were strong to very strong positive associations between MSEL and VABS AE scores by domain. The level of agreement between the MSEL and VABS AE scores by domain ranged from moderate (fine/gross motor), to good (receptive language), to excellent (expressive language) agreement.Conclusions and Implications: Parent reported information from the VABS provides a portrait of age-level functioning comparable to an in-person behavioral assessment (MSEL) with individual variability by domain. This study provides guidance to clinicians and researchers about the selection of tools when using assessments for developmental monitoring of skills across domains. JASPER may be a viable treatment option to improve joint engagement and emotion regulation in young children with DS. Parents appear receptive to learning and implementing JASPER strategies at home. Remote JASPER delivery may improve participation in research or treatment programs."

    "research_summary": "Are the grid cells discovered in rodents relevant to human cognition? Following up on two seminal studies by others, we aimed to check whether an approximate 6-fold, grid-like symmetry shows up in the cortical activity of humans who \"navigate\" between vowels, given that vowel space can be approximated with a continuous trapezoidal 2D manifold, spanned by the first and second formant frequencies. We created 30 vowel trajectories in the assumedly flat central portion of the trapezoid. Each of these trajectories had a duration of 240 milliseconds, with a steady start and end point on the perimeter of a \"wheel\". We hypothesized that if the neural representation of this \"box\" is similar to that of rodent grid units, there should be an at least partial hexagonal (6-fold) symmetry in the EEG response of participants who navigate it. We have not found any dominant n-fold symmetry, however, but instead, using PCAs, we find indications that the vowel representation may reflect phonetic features, as positioned on the vowel manifold. The suggestion, therefore, is that vowels are encoded in relation to their salient sensory-perceptual variables, and are not assigned to arbitrary grid-like abstract maps. Finally, we explored the relationship between the first PCA eigenvector and putative vowel attractors for native Italian speakers, who served as the subjects in our study."

It selectively blocked impulse conduction in large diameter fibres of the retinal ganglion cells. Electrophysiological examination of single optic axons several weeks later demonstrated a gross alteration of the visual properties of the affected BT/Y ganglion cells. It is suggested that the alteration of receptive field properties may reflect the cellular and dendritic response to distant focal injury of the axon."

    "research_summary": "Introduction: A womanssexualityis an essential component of herflourish. Knowledge about womanssexuality isnecessary for a fulfillingsexual life. In Morocco,knowledge about femalesexualityisoftenbased on cultural beliefs. The objective of ourstudyis to evaluate the knowledge of womenssexuality in a population of educatedwomen. Methods: Our studyconsisted of a survey of 168 educatedwomen. The respondentsanswered an anonymous self-questionnaire with items related to the anatomy of the female body, foreplay, the female attitude duringsexual intercourse, femaleorgasm and contraception. Results:The averagenumber of correct answerswas 86% (SD=0.17%).The active role of the woman in sexual intercourse wasendorsed by all participants (100% correct response).The mostfrequenterrorwas the requirement for simultaneousorgasm. Conclusion: Our study gave us an idea of the overallknowledgelevel of educatedwomen, whichwasgenerally good. The education of the womanwould have allowed an acquisition of sexualknowledge as well as a neutralization of the myths and beliefsinheritedfrom theculture. Introduction: Substance use is a major public health problem. Medical students are an interesting population category to study, given the particularity of the stress factors to which they are exposed, predisposing them to the use of psychoactive substances. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of psychoactive substance use in this category, as well as the levels of dependence and risky use, and also to define the characteristics of use and the relationship between substance use and sociodemographic characteristics. Methods: Cross-sectional study with a descriptive aim, carried out in the form of a survey using a questionnaire, among 456 medical students in Casablanca, all levels combined. Results: The most widespread psychoactive substances are tobacco: 16.6%, chicha: 15.3%, cannabis: 14.9% and alcohol: 13.1%. The highest rate of risky use was noted with tobacco use: 30%, and cannabis use: 80%. More than half of the users had a family background of use, and one third of the users were repeaters. The age of initiation, for all substances, varied between 10 and 29 years. In our study, 18.6% of the students were poly-substance users. Psychiatric background was found in 42% of users vs 17% of non-users. Conclusion: The extent of psychoactive substance use among students is considerable, and the study has made it possible to identify certain socio-demographic risk factors. Background: Internet addiction may be a major health problem among students. Indeed, its prevalence is higher than that found in the general population. Aim: to assess the prevalence of cyberaddiction as well as the factors associated with cyberaddiction in a sample of Moroccan university students. Methods: We used an online questionnaire including sociodemographic and clinical data, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Statistical analysis: IBM's Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows, version 26. Results: The current prevalence of cyberaddiction among students was 30.9%, with no significant difference according to gender. A younger age, long duration of internet use (p&lt;0.001), activities of social media (p&lt;0.01) and the video game (p&lt;0.03) were the correlated with cyberaddiction. On the other hand, a significant association was found between internet addiction and high levels of depression and anxiety (p&lt;0.001), as well as with low self-esteem (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, a statistically significant association was found between internet addiction and high levels of depression and anxiety (p&lt;0.001), as well as with low self-esteem (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: The study suggests an association between young age, long duration of Internet use and the risk for developing cyberaddiction. Depressive and anxiety levels, low self-esteem, are also associated with cyberaddiction. The study suggests that considering the high prevalence of this kind of addiction, an awareness and prevention programme for cyberaddiction is needed among this student population. Background: Fasting during the month of Ramadan represents one of the five pillars of Islam. All adult Muslims around the world are required to comply with this religious obligation every year. During Ramadan month, fasting people abstain from eating, drinking and having sexual intercourse from sunrise to sunset. Ramadan occurs in the ninthmonth of the lunar calendar, lasting between 29 and 30 days. The lunar calendar does not correspond to the Gregorian one therefore, Ramadan canoccur in all seasons, varying from year to year. The cycle of the sun marks the beginning and the end of fasting. Its duration varies depending on the season: about 18 hours in the summer to about 12 hours during winter. During this month, daily religious practice is emphasized in all its aspects daily routine is framed"

    "research_summary": "Active photonic systems comprising arrays of active metasurfaces\u2500arrays of tunable resonators\u2500offer dynamic wavefront control at subwavelength scales. Transmissive metasurfaces are an essential requirement in cascaded arrays of metasurfaces and enable integration with chip-scale light sources and detectors. However, most existing active phase control metasurface designs are reflective due to fundamental limitations in single-resonance transmissive architectures, which typically exhibit a transmission null at resonance and restrict transmitted phase shifts to 0-180\u00b0. We report an approach to overcome these constraints by introducing additional diffraction ports in reflection while maintaining a single transmission port. This configuration enables continuous 0-360\u00b0 phase tuning in transmission using a single resonance while avoiding the transmission zero. Moreover, we analytically demonstrate using temporal coupled-mode theory that this approach supports a spectrally flat transmission amplitude across the entire phase range\u2500an effect previously observed only in multiresonant (Kerker-type) systems. Unlike those, our design allows dynamic phase control with a single resonance and a constant transmission. To validate our theory, we present proof-of-concept active metasurfaces using lithium niobate as the tunable material. Two designs are explored via full-wave simulations: one using high-Q germanium Mie resonators at 3 \u03bcm, achieving \u223c250\u00b0 tunable phase shift with constant transmission amplitude \u223c0.45; and another using silicon resonators at telecom wavelengths, demonstrating \u223c300\u00b0 phase shift with amplitude \u223c0.4. Both approach the theoretical transmission bound of 0.5. Our approach enables compact, dynamically tunable transmissive metasurfaces with near-ideal phase and amplitude characteristics, paving the way for integrated, reconfigurable metasurfaces. Achieving spatiotemporal control of light at subwavelength and subcycle scales is an important milestone in the development of new photonic materials and technologies. Ultrafast spatiotemporal light modulation currently relies on electronic interband and intraband transitions that yield pronounced refractive index changes but typically suffer from slow, picosecond response times due to carrier relaxation. Here we show that by leveraging resonant light-matter interactions in a high-quality factor metasurface it is possible to use the optical Kerr effect, a weaker, but instantaneous optoelectronic polarization effect, to achieve ultrafast, reconfigurable light modulation with unprecedented spatial and temporal control. By the subwavelength all-optical tuning of the refractive index of the dielectric metasurface unit cells, we experimentally demonstrate pulse-limited beam steering with a 74-fs response time at angles up to $\\pm $13\u00b0 in the near-infrared. The steering originates from the Kerr effect with a background contribution arising from slower two-photon-excited free carrier absorption. Additionally, we observe spatial back-action, linear frequency conversion, and demonstrate arbitrary ultrafast spatial light modulation in two dimensions. Our findings open the possibility of realizing new ultrafast physics in metastructures with applications in signal processing, pulse shaping, and ultrafast imaging. Systems of the complexity required to use sunlight and components of air to generate useful fuels involve many components that must be discovered and developed as an ensemble. The large number of possible materials compositions and process conditions required can be examined using high throughput experimental and computational techniques. In this talk we will describe recent advances by the Liquid Sunlight Alliance DOE Energy Innovation Hub toward identifying and optimizing (photo)electrocatalytic conditions and materials compositions for conversion of CO 2 to desired products using accelerated methods, and discuss opportunities for further improvements. These methods are generic, and should be broadly applicable to many electrochemistry-based projects within the DOE Energy Materials Networks."

    "research_summary": "Abstract From 10 to 12 May 2024, a series of coronal mass ejections led to one of the strongest geomagnetic storms of the century, referred to as the Mother's Day or Gannon Storm. MMS's position on the dayside magnetosphere on 11 May provided observations of a strongly driven and compressed reconnecting magnetopause. Because of the driving conditions, the magnetopause became saturated with outflows that dominated the mass density of the plasma environment. In the reconnecting magnetopause, MMS observes signatures of parallel electron heating on the magnetopause's magnetosheath side, but anomalous and significant electron cooling, especially from the perpendicular electron temperature on the magnetosphere side, possibly driven by additional mechanisms besides reconnection. Even with the strong driving and outflows, we find an expected normalized reconnection rate for the primary exhaust, indicating insensitivity to these conditions. The unnormalized rate, however, is atypically large and scales with the driving conditions. <title>Abstract</title> <bold>Magnetic reconnection, a fundamental process</bold> <bold>in laboratory, space and astrophysical plasmas, can transfer magnetic field energy into particles\u2019 kinetic and thermal energy, leading to many explosive phenomena, such as solar flares and astrophysical jets. It has been believed that reconnection-driven energy transfer typically occurs inside reconnection ejecta, particular reconnection fronts (RFs), which can host localized, ultrastrong energy transfer (UET) directly controlling large-scale energy transport. However, origin of the RF-driven UET remains unclear. Here, using state-of-the-art measurements from NASA\u2019s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft, we perform a comprehensive investigation of UET at RFs. We reveal that the UET hosts two different regimes: ion-dominated laminar regime and electron-dominated turbulent regime. The transition between the two regimes is controlled by an electron-ion hybrid instability, which can generate lower hybrid turbulence feeding intense electric fields. We find that Hall term in the generalized Ohm\u2019s law, rather than traditionally-believed electron pressure gradient term, plays a more significant role in balancing the intense electric fields. These results provide novel insights into understanding reconnection-driven energy transport chain widely present in the cosmos.</bold>"

    "research_summary": "For 60 years, the <i>Environmental Science</i> <i>& Technology</i> research community has helped to define the fields of environmental science and engineering. The research topics have evolved over time to respond to the most pressing societal needs, from treatment technologies and pollution control strategies to address severe environmental pollution, to pollution prevention and industrial ecology to help mitigate emissions, and to defining planetary boundaries for sustainability. Since <i>ES</i><i>&T</i> launched in 1967, it has helped to create a robust global network of researchers, with researchers from 144 countries now contributing to address critical global environmental and human health challenges. Throughout its six decades, <i>ES</i><i>&T</i> research has remained highly relevant to understanding, addressing, and advancing solutions to both current and emerging challenges and for developing science-based policies to protect the environment and human health. We are optimistic that the <i>ES</i><i>&T</i> research community will continue to serve to help shape research and action toward a healthier, resilient, and sustainable planet for all of us in the next 60 years. Visceral adiposity and insulin resistance are key contributors to acute myocardial infarction (AMI), yet their combined predictive value remains unclear. Metabolic score for visceral fat (METS-VF) and metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) are novel indices reflecting visceral fat and insulin resistance, respectively, with potential to improve AMI risk assessment and guide early preventive strategies in clinical practice. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from 29,505 adults aged \u2265 20 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005 to 2018. METS-VF and METS-IR were calculated from clinical and biochemical parameters. Associations with self-reported AMI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression and restricted cubic spline models, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle, and clinical covariates. Subgroup analyses were performed by sex and obesity status. Participants with METS-VF &gt; 6.94 and METS-IR &gt; 35.5 had significantly higher AMI risk (adjusted odds ratios (ORs) = 1.51 [95% CI: 1.10\u20132.07] and 1.01 [95% CI: 1.00\u20131.02], respectively). Nonlinear dose\u2013response relationships were observed, with risk rising steeply above these thresholds. Stratified analyses showed the associations were significant in males (METS-VF OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.40\u20133.23; METS-IR OR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.04) and non-obese individuals (METS-VF OR = 1.68, 95% CI: 1.18\u20132.40; METS-IR OR = 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00\u20131.02), but not in females or obese subgroups. METS-VF and METS-IR are independent, nonlinear predictors of AMI risk, with stronger predictive value in males and non-obese adults. By integrating measures of visceral fat and insulin resistance, these indices may help clinicians identify high-risk individuals and tailor preventive interventions, thereby enhancing personalized cardiovascular risk assessment and improving early management outcomes."

To mitigate this, cellular life has evolved the ferritin protein superfamily, which includes the 24 subunit ferritins and bacterioferritins, and 12 subunit mini-ferritins (DPS). Each catalyze the oxidation of Fe(II) to ferric oxyhydroxide, which is then sequestered within the hollow protein shell. While there is a wealth of structural information on unmineralized ferritins, high resolution information on iron loaded ferritins is lacking, and the mechanism of iron mineralization is poorly understood. To address this, we followed iron loading in a mini-ferritin by cryo-EM. We determined a 1.86 \u00c5 structure in the unmineralized state, as well as a 1.91 \u00c5 structure of an early, iron loading state in which the mini-ferritin catalyzes nucleation of ferric oxyhydroxide at the acidic 3-fold pores. Mechanistically, a conserved crucible of precisely positioned glutamates and unsaturated main chain carbonyls are employed as a template to catalyze nucleation. A 2.4 \u00c5 structure at a later time point was also determined, revealing the role of a second constellation of main-chain carbonyls on the interior surface that subsequently supports crystalline mineral growth, that then proceeds into the center of the particle. Notably, the visualized mineral is consistent with one of two competing structural descriptions for ferrihydrite. This study provides the first pseudoatomic level observation of controlled mineral nucleation and growth in any member of the ferritin superfamily, and informs general mechanisms of nucleation and biomineralization. Salt dialysis is a versatile approach to engineer multilayered ordered arrays starting from a one-pot mixture. Control over the selectivity of catalytic materials is a topic of growing interest. Virus-like particle (VLP) based materials such as protein macromolecular frameworks (PMFs) are promising for catalytic applications due to their ease of assembly, modular ability to encapsulate a variety of enzymes, and ease of separation from a reaction mixture. Here we demonstrate the reversal of the initially negative material charge through the titration of a positively charged polymer into the material, causing the reversal of guest molecule uptake and enzymatic activity of PMFs. The charge-inverse material partitions a charged enzyme substrate to concentrate the substrate near an enzyme incorporated within the material, generating up to 5.9-fold increases in enzyme activity toward the partitioned substrate over the excluded substrate. Here we also show that the polymer distributes heterogeneously through the material up to a point of saturation and the effects of guest macromolecules on the lattice parameters of PMFs."

    "research_summary": "When a train catches fire inside an extra-long tunnel, fixed-point rescue is widely used. The distance between fixed points determines whether the train can stop safely. However, in many countries, regulations dictate a maximum of 20 km, and each tunnel and train have different characteristics. Fixed points are mainly designed based on experience, which may be detrimental to precise risk control. In this paper, a risk probability calculation model for fire train fixed-point stopping in railway tunnels is developed, which takes into account train operation characteristics and tunnel engineering parameters. Based on quantitative calculations, the role of major factors is discussed, and an empirical formula for safe deceleration at different station distances is established. The study reveals that: 1) the reliability of the 20-km distance standard is contingent on train equilibrium speeds exceeding 80 km/h; 2) at a distance of 20 km, the risk probability of fixed-point stopping varies from 0.011% to 10.06%. Better train braking capacity and greater uphill slopes can reduce the risk, with the latter playing a more significant role; and 3) there is a safe deceleration that maintains the risk probability below 0.03%. This is determined primarily by longitudinal grades and train braking capacity. As the fixed-point distance increases, the required safe deceleration grows exponentially. Graphene films with tunable wettability exhibit great potential in energy storage, sensing, and microfluidics. However, achieving precise control over their hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties remains a critical challenge. Herein, we develop a two-step laser processing method for ambient-air fabrication of fluorine-doped graphene (F-LIG) films with tunable wettability. The method involves picosecond UV laser pyrolysis of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP)/polyimide (PI) films followed by CO<sub>2</sub> laser annealing of the resultant F-LIG films. The formation mechanisms were clarified through microstructure and chemical characterizations and molecular dynamics simulation. Results demonstrate that the UV laser induces a transient high-temperature/pressure environment at the FEP/PI interface, facilitating fluorine diffusion and C-F covalent bonding to yield superhydrophobic F-LIG. Subsequent laser annealing reconstructs the carbon lattice, removes unstable fluorine residues, regulates oxygen-containing groups, and constructs through-pores. This annealing process achieves nearly linear wettability tuning from superhydrophobicity (160.2\u00b0) to near-superhydrophilicity (15.4\u00b0) by modulating surface energy. Moreover, the near-superhydrophilic F-LIG demonstrates excellent conductivity and capacitive performance (8.9 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>) in microcapacitors, enabling integrated applications. Significantly, all integrated microcapacitors spanning 1 to 30 cells maintain excellent performance consistency and scalable series-parallel performance. This work provides an approach for the efficient processing of graphene with on-demand wettability engineering and monolithic integration of energy storage."

    "research_summary": "Long-duration energy storage is commonly viewed as a key technology for providing flexibility to the grid and broader energy systems over a multidecadal time frame. However, prior work has typically used present-day grid infrastructures to characterize the relationship between the duration and arbitrage value of storage in electricity markets. This study leverages established National Renewable Energy Laboratory grid planning and operations tools, analysis, and data to execute a price-taker model of an energy storage system for several 8760 h price series representative of current and future contiguous United States grid infrastructures with varying shares of variable renewable energy (VRE). We find that the total value of energy storage typically increases with VRE shares, but any increase in the relative value of longer storage durations over time depends on the region and grid mix. Some regions see incremental value increasing notably, up to 20\u201340 h in 2050, while others do not. The negative effect of lower roundtrip efficiency on value is also found to be scenario-dependent, with the energy value in higher VRE scenarios being less sensitive to roundtrip efficiency and more supportive of longer storage durations. Long-duration storage value and deployment potential are a function of evolving electricity sector infrastructure, markets, and policy, making it critical to consistently revisit potential long-duration storage contributions to the grid. Maintaining the reliability of the bulk power system, which supplies and transmits electricity, is a critical priority of electric grid planners, operators, and regulators. As demand for electricity increases and the U.S. resource mix changes, how grid operators meet peak demand is changing. In summer 2024, grid operators in all regions maintained enough capacity to keep the lights and air conditioners on during periods of peak demand, even as older generators have been retired. And, an increasing number of regions used more solar and storage to meet peak demand. In this publication, we describe grid operations on the highest demand day in ERCOT and a few other regions and how solar and storage in particular worked together to help meet peak demand. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and other organizations have sponsored numerous research studies over the last two decades to examine the effect of increased wind and solar deployment on grid reliability, including a number of studies that examine grids deriving more than 50% of annual energy from wind and solar. In this report, we discuss key findings from both the research body of knowledge and real-world practice related to grid reliability, and we demonstrate how to plan for and achieve continued reliability in the future as wind and solar deployment increase."

    "research_summary": "A compact and low-loss multimode waveguide bend plays a significant role in multimode channels and high-density on-chip optical interconnection architectures, and it has become a key component of photonic integrated chips. Here, we propose an inverse design method based on staged optimization of high-order Bezier curves with high degrees of freedom, which effectively overcomes the optimization limitations of traditional geometric curve design. Using this approach, we demonstrate an ultra-compact 90\u00b0 multimode waveguide bend on a 220 nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform, featuring an effective bending radius as small as 9 \u03bcm and supporting four TE modes. Furthermore, the bend is extended to arbitrary angle interconnects, with 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 configurations as examples, significantly enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of on-chip compact multimode interconnections. Simulation results show that 90\u00b0 bend exhibits excellent performance at 1550 nm with excess losses below 0.038 dB and crosstalk below \u221230 dB . The proposed design was further fabricated and experimentally characterized. The maximum measured excess loss is 0.13 dB, and the inter-mode crosstalk is all below \u221225 dB at 1550 nm. This device combines ultra-compact footprint, low loss, and excellent scalability, suitable for high-density on-chip interconnects."

This chapter discusses recent advances in self-healing thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers in the context of physico-chemical events responsible for repair processes. The first part focuses on thermodynamic considerations of self-healing and the role of entropic and enthalpic contributions to the Gibbs free energy during self-healing events. The recoupling self-healing lattice model allows an estimate of the contributions of configurational changes and chemical reactions occurring during self-healing to the Gibbs free energy. As chains transition from non-equilibrium to equilibrium Gaussian states during self-healing, the magnitude of entropic and enthalpic contributions undergoes dynamic changes that lead to equilibrium at which the Gibbs free energy reaches the minimum. The second part reviews recent advances in chemical reactions that enable remolding thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers by reforming covalent bonding, supramolecular chemistries, weak interactions such as van der Waals forces, and shape memory effects. Although self-healing materials continue to be scientifically exciting and technologically important, combining multi-facet reactions and precision copolymerization offers significant promise in developing new self-healing thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers. Abstract Commodity aliphatic and aromatic acrylic\u2010based copolymers self\u2010heal due to ubiquitous key\u2010and\u2010lock , ring\u2010and\u2010lock , and fluorophilic\u2010\u03c3\u2010lock van der Waals (vdW) interactions. However, the role of these interactions in the presence of covalently copolymerized ionic liquid (IL) is not known. This study is driven by the hypothesis that covalently incorporated cation\u2013anion pairs to form poly(ionic liquid) copolymers (PILCs) can perturb inter\u2010 or intra\u2010chain vdW inter"

    "research_summary": "The Germans coined the word Gedankenexperiment , or a thought experiment , to visualize a hypothetical scenario with imagination and reasoning and to arrive at a conclusion without performing an actual (physical) experiment in a \u201claboratory.\u201d These thought experiments by very clever people arguably were the genesis of many or all of the concepts we routinely use in our technical world, namely: Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, wave particle duality, the list goes on and on. Given the chatter and current debate on the pros and cons of artificial intelligence (or AI), I figured why not try my hand and do a thought experiment on it as well. Unlike the well-studied and technologically advanced Group III-V and Group II-VI compound semiconductor alloys, alloys of ternary metal oxide semiconductors have only recently begun to receive widespread attention. In this talk, we describe the effect of alkaline earth metal substitution on the optical, electronic, and photoelectrochemical (PEC) properties of several families of copper vanadates. As a host, the Cu-V-O compound family presents a versatile framework to develop such composition-property correlations. Alloy compositions and photoanodes were synthesized via a time and energy-efficient solution combustion synthesis (SCS) method. The effect of introducing alkaline earth metals (Mg, Ca, Sr) on the crystal structure, microstructure, electronic, and optical properties of the host ternary oxide compound framework was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Raman spectroscopy. The PXRD, TEM, and Raman spectroscopy data demonstrated the polycrystalline powder samples to be mutually soluble, solid solutions of copper and alkaline earth metal metavanadates and not simple mixtures of these compounds. The DRS data showed a systematic decrease in the optical bandgap with Cu incorporation. These trends were corroborated by electronic band structure calculations. Ways in which electronic parameters such as electron affinity may be modulated via alloying will be demonstrated. Finally, the PEC properties exhibited a strong dependence on the alloy composition, pointing to possible applicability in solar water splitting, heterogeneous photocatalysis, phosphor lighting/displays, or photovoltaic devices.

The copper-(II) complex of 4-benzylpiperazinyldithiocarbamate was synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques and single crystal X-ray crystallography. The single crystal X-ray structure of the compound revealed a centrosymmetric dimeric molecule with the copper-(II) ions situated in a distorted five-coordinate square pyramidal environment. The complex was used as a single source precursor for the preparation of copper sulfide nanoparticles capped with three capping agents, octadecylamine (ODA), dodecylamine (DDA), and hexadecylamine (HDA) and at three different temperatures, 120 \u00b0C, 160 \u00b0C and 220 \u00b0C. Powder X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed mainly chalcocite crystalline phases of copper sulfide with some minor peaks of roxbyite phase. The optical band gaps for the nanoparticles range from 4.07 to 4.16 eV, with a maximum absorption band edge of 283.7 nm. The morphological studies revealed different shapes ranging from spherical, hexagonal, and irregular shapes with average particle sizes ranging from 4.1 to 74.7 nm. The photocatalytic studies of the nanoparticles under visible light demonstrated an efficient photodegradation of trypan blue dye. Dodecylamine capped copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS-DDA) and copper sulfide prepared at 120 \u00b0C (CuS-120) achieved 99.31% and 99.26% photocatalytic degradation efficiency with a rate constant of 0.03045 and 0.02749 min<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Scavenger studies revealed the role of reactive species in trypan blue degradation by copper sulfide nanoparticles. Recyclability experiments showed excellent stability and reusability of the nanoparticles, demonstrating their potential for sustained photocatalytic applications. This study presents the combined and complementary use of two techniques, namely, intensity modulated photocurrent spectroscopy (IMPS) and photoelectrochemical impedance spectroscopy (PEIS) for the study of partially or wholly replacing copper with an alkaline earth metal (Mg, Ca) in a metavanadate compound matrix (MV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). To this end, the three reference compounds (CuV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, CaV<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, MgV<sub>2</sub>O) and two alloy compositions (Mg<sub>0.1</sub>Cu<sub>0.9</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> and Ca<sub>0.1</sub>Cu<sub>0.9</sub>V<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), obtained from a solution combustion technique, were screen-printed on fluorine-dope"

    "research_summary": "A process for selection of oxygen-tolerant, H.sub.2 -producing algal mutant cells comprising: (a) growing algal cells photoautotrophically under fluorescent light to mid log phase; (b) inducing algal cells grown photoautrophically under fluorescent light to mid log phase in step (a) anaerobically by (1) resuspending the cells in a buffer solution and making said suspension anaerobic with an inert gas; (2) incubating the suspension in the absence of light at ambient temperature; (c) treating the cells from step (b) with metronidazole, sodium azide, and added oxygen to controlled concentrations in the presence of white light. (d) washing off metronidazole and sodium azide to obtain final cell suspension; (e) plating said final cell suspension on a minimal medium and incubating in light at a temperature sufficient to enable colonies to appear; (f) counting the number of colonies to determine the percent of mutant survivors; and (g) testing survivors to identify oxygen-tolerant H.sub.2 -producing mutants. Ferredoxin5 (FDX5), a minor ferredoxin protein in the alga <i>Chlamydomonas</i> (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>), helps maintain thylakoid membrane integrity in the dark. Sulfur (S) deprivation has been used to achieve prolonged hydrogen production in green algae. Here, we propose that FDX5 is involved in algal responses to S-deprivation as well as to the dark. Specifically, we tested the role of FDX5 in both the initial aerobic and subsequent anaerobic phases of S-deprivation. Under S-deprived conditions, absence of FDX5 causes a distinct delay in achieving anoxia by affecting photosynthetic O<sub>2</sub> evolution, accompanied by reduced acetate uptake, lower starch accumulation, and delayed/lower fermentative metabolite production, including photohydrogen. We attribute these differences to transcriptional and/or posttranslational regulation of acetyl-CoA synthetase and ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, and increased stability of the PSII D1 protein. Interestingly, increased levels of FDX2 and FDX1 were observed in the mutant under oxic, S-replete conditions, strengthening our previously proposed hypothesis that other ferredoxins compensate in response to a lack of FDX5. Taken together, the results of our omics and pull-down experiments confirmed biochemical and physiological results, suggesting that FDX5 may have other effects on <i>Chlamydomonas</i> metabolism through its interaction with multiple redox partners. NREL researchers will work closely with Nzyme2HC to develop and evaluate a novel process for enzymatic production of renewable hydrogen to deliver a potentially high-yield and low-cost renewable biofuels."

    "research_summary": "This paper presents a novel free-space optical Angle-of-Arrival (AOA) estimation method based on arrayed waveguide coherent mode decoding, aiming to surpass the inherent limitations of traditional AOA detection technologies, which face significant challenges in achieving miniaturization, low complexity, and high reliability. The method utilizes the AOA-related phase differences generated by the propagation and interference of incident light in an arrayed input waveguide, forming multi-beam interference fringes at the output end of the slab waveguide. This pattern is then sampled by an arrayed output waveguide to produce an intensity sequence, which is then fed into a trained CNN\u2013Attention Regressor for AOA estimation. This study innovatively applies the method to decoding the spatial angular information of optical signals. Simulation results demonstrate the exceptional performance of our approach, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0142\u00b0 and a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.0193\u00b0 over a 40\u00b0 field of view. This precision is significantly superior to conventional peak\u2013linear calibration methods and other common neural network architectures, and exhibits remarkable robustness against simulated phase noise and manufacturing tolerances. This research demonstrates the powerful synergy between integrated photonics and deep learning, paving the way for a new class of highly integrated, robust, and high-performance on-chip optical sensors. ABSTRACT Conventional non\u2010noble hydrogen evolution reaction catalysts are plagued by excessive hydrogen adsorption and instability. To overcome this, we pioneer a high\u2010entropy single\u2010atom (HESA) catalyst via precise anchoring of multiple transition metals on carbon supports. The HESA catalyst achieves record\u2010breaking alkaline HER performance of 44 mV@10 mA cm \u22122 (matching commercial Pt/C catalyst) and 300 h stability, resolving the persistent activity\u2010stability trade\u2010off. Systematical characterizations reveal that low\u2010coordination metal sites induce significant metal\u2010support charge redistribution. Electronegative supports withdraw electrons from metal centers, while \u03c0\u2010back\u2010donation downshifts metal d\u2010band centers, optimizing the Gibbs free energy of intermediate H atoms (\u0394G H* ). Atomic\u2010scale imaging further confirms uniform charge distribution and \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m\u2010level electric field response. Crucially, adjacent multi\u2010metal sites synergistically lower energy barriers for both water dissociation and hydrogen desorption through a synergistic electronic buffering effect. This work establishes entropy\u2010driven microenvironment engineering as a paradigm for cooperative optimization of active sites and electronic structures, opening avenues for durable non\u2010precious catalysts. Abstract X\u2010ray imaging holds great promise in medical diagnosis, industrial nondestructive examination, and security screening. However, developing scintillators that simultaneously achieve high spatial resolution and long\u2010term operational stability remains a significant challenge. Herein, Tb 3+ \u2010 and Eu 3+ \u2010doped small\u2010sized CsLu 2 F 7 (CLF) nanocrystal scintillators are reported. The high atomic numbers of Cs and Lu enhance X\u2010ray attenuation, while nanocrystal dimensions minimize light scattering, enabling the fabrication of transparent, thin scintillator films with efficient X\u2010ray interaction. The nanocrystals exhibit green (Tb 3 \u207a) or red (Eu 3 \u207a) emission, and demonstrate a low detectable dose rate of 0.48 \u00b5Gy s \u22121 for Tb 3 \u207a doped CLF. Importantly, the nanocrystal scintillators possess excellent long\u2010term stability against high\u2010dose X\u2010ray irradiation, humidity, and elevated temperature. Incorporation of nanocrystals into waterborne polyurethane (PU), CLF\u201025%Tb@PU films, yields a high spatial resolution of 30 lp mm \u22121 and a film thickness of \u2248 200 \u00b5m. Notably, these films enable high\u2010contrast 2D projection imaging of various objects. These results highlight the great potential of as\u2010prepared scintillators in X\u2010ray imaging applications."

    "research_summary": "Key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation (SE), protection, and fault location) rely on the availability of models to represent the system\u2019s behavior under different operating conditions. Power system models require knowledge of the components\u2019 electrical parameters and the system topology. However, these data may be inaccurate for several reasons (e.g., inaccurate information of components datasheets and/or outdated topological information). The deployment of time synchronization in phasor measurement units (PMUs) and remote terminal units (RTUs) enables the collection of large datasets of synchronized measurements to infer power system models and learn associated power flow constraints. Within this context, this article presents a comprehensive review of measurement-based estimation methods for power flow models using time-synchronized measurements. It begins by exploring advancements in time dissemination technologies and the characterization of uncertainties in PMUs and instrument transformers (ITs), along with their implications for parameter estimation. This article then examines the power system parameter estimation problem, highlighting key techniques and methodologies. In the following, this article focuses on measurement models for state-independent power flow model estimation, including line parameters, admittance matrices, topology, and joint state-parameter estimation. Finally, this article discusses recent approaches for estimating state-dependent power flow models, with particular reference to linearized power flow approximations because of their large use in control applications. This paper is concerned with the issue of potential non-unique solutions in three-phase state estimation. Theory of observability analysis for positive sequence power system state estimation is based on certain assumptions that avoid possibility of multiple solutions. Also, it is shown that observability of a positive sequence network remains independent of the network parameters or the operating state. When extending single-phase observability analysis directly to the three-phase case, this paper considers the possibility of converging to multiple solutions, i.e. solution non-uniqueness, even for cases where state estimator successfully converges. The study illustrates via numerical examples the likelihood of converging to entirely different solutions for certain network parameters. It also examines how the operating state, particularly under unbalanced loading, leads to solution non-uniqueness. The paper then describes an alternative approach to ensure a unique solution in three-phase state estimation. This method aims to accurately and uniquely estimate the state of any unbalanced three-phase system, irrespective of load imbalance, network configuration, existence of synchronous generators or transformers."

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT Potential\u2010induced degradation (PID) is a critical failure mechanism that compromises the outdoor stability of photovoltaic devices, yet its underlying causes remain inadequately understood in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). This study examines the degradation of PSCs under PID stress, followed by exposure to ambient air containing water and oxygen. We found that corrosion initiates at the interface between the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and glass. Notably, fluorine\u2010doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates exhibited a dramatic 290\u2010fold increase in sheet resistance, compared to just a twofold increase in indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. Surface chemical analyses reveal that the corrosion is driven by a series of electrochemical reactions, including the voltage\u2010driven migration of sodium ions, oxidation of tin oxide, and the ingress of atmospheric moisture. Both FTO\u2010 and ITO\u2010based PSCs experienced significant performance degradation when exposed to air, with FTO\u2010based cells suffering more severe damage, including electrochemical corrosion and delamination, ultimately leading to near\u2010zero current density and complete device failure. Isolating the cells from air for 20 days after PID stress significantly mitigated performance degradation. Module\u2010level investigations revealed similar corrosion patterns, particularly at the P3 scribe lines, where FTO is exposed. This study highlights the crucial role of environmental factors in PID and underscores the need for improved encapsulation strategies to enhance the long\u2010term stability of PSCs in real\u2010world applications. The discovery of chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) revolutionized our understanding of the capabilities of chiral molecules, revealing that chiral molecules can function as spin filters, aligning the spin orientation of electrons when they transmit through them. Recently, CISS has been exploited to direct energy conversion, especially the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, despite the remarkable progress that has been achieved, the effect of CISS in influencing the intermediate species formation and changing the rate-determining step (RDS) is still vague. To understand those key reaction mechanism steps, electrocatalysts with distinct magnetic characteristics, ferromagnetic CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and paramagnetic Co<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, were synthesized. The results show that spin-polarized charge carriers retain their spin alignment when coupled with ferromagnetic CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, akin to the behavior observed under a magnetic field. The Tafel analysis and kinetic isotope studies (kinetic isotope effect) suggest that in the absence of chiral molecules, the initial electron transfer step, the formation of O* species, governs the rate-determining step (RDS). However, introducing chiral molecules shifts the RDS to a combination of the first and second electron transfers, leading to the formation of OOH*. This conclusion was further supported by in situ infrared spectroscopy, which shows that l-methionine-modified CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (l-CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) promotes the formation of OOH*, a key intermediate for O<sub>2</sub> generation. This study highlights the critical role of CISS in affecting the OER mechanism and intermediate species formation. ABSTRACT Reliable steady\u2010state testing protocols are crucial for accurately evaluating the performance of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we systematically compare the asymptotic P MAX scan and the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method to assess their effectiveness in steady\u2010state efficiency measurements. We introduce the current density standard deviation factor as a stability criterion in the asymptotic P MAX scan, and implement a convergence amplitude to regulate the voltage adjustment speed toward the maximum power point. There is a possible tendency that the performance of state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art perovskite solar cells improved in the asymptotic P MAX scan in low\u2010to\u2010high voltage directions. Numerical device simulations reveal that this improvement is due to a reduction in the trap state density in both the perovskite bulk and at the interfaces. We further compare asymptotic P MAX scans conducted in both low\u2010to\u2010high and high\u2010to\u2010low voltage directions, demonstrating their strong consistency and repeatability on state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art perovskite solar cells. Our results show that the steady\u2010state P MAX obtained from the asymptotic P MAX scan closely matches, but can be slightly higher than, that from MPPT. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of steady\u2010state testing methods for perovskite solar cells, offering a foundation for more accurate performance characterization and certification."

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> Interregional electricity trade in the United States reduces total energy costs, but falls short of maximizing the economic potential of existing transmission infrastructure. This analysis of 32 U.S. electricity system interfaces crossing grid or market seams finds an average achieved cost savings of at least $1226 million per year. This positive impact is offset by an average annual cost of uneconomic interchange of $551 million. Additional value of at least $238 million per year is left on the table due to under-utilization. Notably, uneconomic flows and low utilization rates can persist even when the price spread between regions is large. These conclusions are derived from historical (2014-2023) data on the magnitude and direction of interregional price spreads, the magnitude and direction of net energy transfers, and how these variables coincide. These findings motivate the development and deployment of solutions that improve interregional transmission operations, in parallel with robust transmission infrastructure planning. Emissions reductions may be met with relatively small costs"

    "research_summary": "The aggregate flexibility region of distributed energy resources (DERs) quantifies the aggregate power shaping capabilities of DERs. It characterizes the distribution network's potential for wholesale market participation and grid service provision at the transmission level. To enhance flexibility and fully exploit the potential of DERs, this paper proposes a method to optimize the aggregate flexibility region through distribution network reconfiguration. First, we formulate the ellipsoidal aggregate flexibility region characterization problem as a two-stage adaptive robust optimization problem and derive an exact convex reformulation with a large number of second-order cone constraints. By exploiting the problem structure, we propose a scalable Benders decomposition algorithm with provable finite convergence to the optimal solution. Finally, we propose an optimal reconfiguration problem for aggregate flexibility region optimization and solve it using the custom Benders decomposition. Numerical simulations on the IEEE 123-bus test feeder demonstrate that, compared to existing approaches, substantial improvements in the aggregate flexibility region can be achieved over multiple scenarios with the optimized topology. This study investigates the impact of behavioral nudgessocial norms, loss aversion framing, default options, and positive narrativeon voluntary pension saving decisions in China. Using a randomized controlled trial administered via an online survey with 220 participants, we examine how these interventions influence both the willingness to contribute and the proportion of income allocated to pension savings. Contrary to prevailing international evidence, our results indicate that all nudges significantly reduce willingness to contribute relative to a control group, with the most substantial backfire effects observed for positive narrative and default option nudges. Furthermore, we identify important heterogeneity effects across income groups and emphasize the moderating roles of education, gender, and financial motivation. These findings underscore the critical importance of cultural, institutional, and individual factors in the design and implementation of behavioral interventions. Policy measures tailored to specific demographic segments and focused on financial education and trust-building are recommended. Underground power distribution systems (PDSs) are increasingly deployed in urban areas. The integration of smart devices including smart switchgears, pad-mounted distribution transformers and inverter-based resources (IBRs) enhance system resilience, however simultaneously introducing unique challenges. The challenges include inrush currents caused by trapped charges in underground cables, ferroresonance in distribution transformers during energization, and three-phase load imbalance resulting from single-phase underground laterals. To address these issues, this paper proposes an underground PDS restoration framework using IBRs. Firstly, an underground cable energization model is developed to quantify inrush current by analyzing voltage differences across both switchgear terminals. Secondly, a distribution transformer energization model is proposed to evaluate ferroresonance using Q-factor constraints based on underground cable capacitance and damping resistance. Thirdly, a phase-swapping model is proposed to improve load balancing by dynamically reassigning lateral-phase connections through smart switchgears. The proposed models are further integrated into a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) formulation to maximize the total weighted restored load while constraining inrush currents, ferroresonance, and phase imbalance. To address the nonlinearity induced by impedance matrix reordering during phase swapping, a permutation-based linearization technique is proposed. Finally, case studies on an underground PDS established based on IEEE 123-Node Test Feeder validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in improving uderground PDS restoration performance. Integrating renewable energy sources into the grid not only reduces global carbon emissions, but also facilitates distribution system (DS) blackstart restoration. This process leverages renewable energy, inverters, situational awareness and distribution automation to initiate blackstart at the DS level, obtaining a fast response and bottom-up restoration. In this Review, we survey the latest technological advances for DS blackstart restoration using renewable energy. We first present mathematical models for distributed energy resources (DERs), network topology, and load dynamics. We then discuss how the situational awareness can help improve restoration performance through real-time monitoring and forecasting. Next, the DS blackstart restoration problem, including objectives, constraints, and existing methodologies for decision-making are provided. Lastly, we outline remaining challenges, and highlight the opportunities and future"

    "research_summary": "We present systematic thermal conductivity (\u03ba) measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3\u03c9 method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high \u03ba in micrometer-thick graphite ( <i>Science</i>, 2020), we observe significantly lower \u03ba and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured \u03ba lies between few-layer graphene and bulk graphite. These results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak \u03ba shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management. Abstract Organic solar cells offer a promising method to convert light into fossil\u2010free energy, yet their performance still cannot compete with their silicon counterparts. Recently, strong exciton\u2010photon coupling has been shown to enhance the properties of organic solar cells. The strong coupling regime is reached by confining the electromagnetic field into a mode that is spatially overlapping and in\u2010resonance with a molecular transition. Traditionally, confining electromagnetic fields requires the use of mirrors, which reduce molecular absorption, thereby diminishing the usefulness for solar cell applications. In this study, angular resolved reflectivity and transfer matrix simulations show that the strong coupling regime can be reached in conventional organic solar cells by using the refractive index contrast between layers, thereby eliminating the need for additional mirrors. By adjusting anode materials and active layer thicknesses, strongly coupled solar cells can achieve efficiencies up to 13.4%. This value is more than twice as high as strongly coupled solar cells prepared with mirrors. The findings introduce a method for implementing the strong coupling regime in organic solar cells without compromising the ability of the system to absorb light, paving the way for strong coupling empowered devices and presenting alternatives for the production of clean energy."

    "research_summary": "We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\u0394$ are provided. Available on GitHub at https://github.com/gridfm/gridfm-datakit under Apache 2.0 and via `pip install gridfm-datakit`. System identification in control theory aims to approximate dynamical systems from trajectory data. While neural networks have demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, they often fail to preserve critical physical properties such as stability and typically assume stationary dynamics, limiting their applicability under distribution shifts. Existing approaches generally address either stability or adaptability in isolation, lacking a unified framework that ensures both. We propose LILAD (Learning In-Context Lyapunov-stable Adaptive Dynamics), a novel framework for system identification that jointly guarantees adaptability and stability. LILAD simultaneously learns a dynamics model and a Lyapunov function through in-context learning (ICL), explicitly accounting for parametric uncertainty. Trained across a diverse set of tasks, LILAD produces a stability-aware, adaptive dynamics model alongside an adaptive Lyapunov certificate. At test time, both components adapt to a new system instance using a short trajectory prompt, which enables fast generalization. To rigorously ensure stability, LILAD also computes a state-dependent attenuator that enforces a sufficient decrease condition on the Lyapunov function for any state in the new system instance. This mechanism extends stability guarantees even under out-of-distribution and out-of-task scenarios. We evaluate LILAD on benchmark autonomous systems and demonstrate that it outperforms adaptive, robust, and non-adaptive baselines in predictive accuracy. Data centers host a variety of essential services such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Electric grid operators, however, have limited knowledge of the reliability risks of data center interconnection due to their unique operational characteristics. An emerging concern is the sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) which refer to unexpected voltage/current oscillations at typical frequencies below 60/50 Hz. It remains unknown whether and how the interactions between data centers and the grid may trigger resonances, equipment damages, and even cascading failures. In this paper, we focus on grid-connected data centers that draw electricity from the grid through power factor correction (PFC) converters. We conduct two-tone frequency sweep to investigate the data centers' impedance characteristics, i.e. magnitude and phase angle variations over frequencies, and showcase their deep dependence on compute workloads. The impedance modeling provides a direct approach to evaluating SSR risks and enable a cooperative mechanism to alarm and avoid resonance-prone situations. Building upon the impedance, a data-driven preventive controller is then established to raise early warnings of risky operation and suggest flexible workload management according to the given grid conditions. Through case study, we demonstrate how to use impedance to understand the unexpected interactions. Data-driven impedance is validated to show decent performance in capturing the unique impedance dips and tracking the impedance variations across a range of workload scenarios. The early warning and preventive control approaches are further effective to improve the safety margins with minimal workload rescheduling. The key findings of this work will provide valuable insights for grid operators and data center managers, and support preparation for future scenarios involving large-scale data center integration. The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) is driving an unprecedented increase in the electricity demand of AI data centers, raising emerging challenges for electric power grids. Understanding the characteristics of AI data center loads and their interactions with the grid is therefore critical for ensuring both reliable power system operation and sustainable "

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> Among numerous energy storage materials, two-dimensional Ti <sub>3</sub> C <sub>2</sub> T <sub>x</sub> -MXene has demonstrated great potential in the electrochemical field due to its unique layered structure, excellent electrical conductivity, large specific surface area and good chemical stability. MXene was prepared by the molten salt method in this paper, using nickel chloride as the etchant, and layered Ti <sub>3</sub> C <sub>2</sub> T <sub>x</sub> -MXene was obtained. Co(NO <sub>3</sub> ) <sub>2</sub> \u00b76H <sub>2</sub> O and Ni(NO <sub>3</sub> ) <sub>2</sub> \u00b76H <sub>2</sub> O were co-reacted with MXene through a hydrothermal reaction to successfully prepare the composite material CoNi/MXene. The results show that when the molar ratio of cobalt nitrate to nickel nitrate is 2:1, the composite material exhibits the most excellent electrochemical energy storage performance. At a current density of 1 A g <sup>\u2212 1</sup> , the specific capacity reached 1390 F g <sup>\u2212 1</sup> . At a high current density of 5 A g <sup>\u2212 1</sup> , the initial specific capacity was 937 F g <sup>\u2212 1</sup> . After 1000 cycles, the capacity retention rate was 73.3% (687 F g <sup>\u2212 1</sup> ), demonstrating excellent cycling stability. Quantifying thermal non-equilibrium between different phonon branches in supported monolayered two-dimensional materials remains a significant challenge due to complex substrate interactions and optical interference in Raman measurements. Here, we report on the direct quantification of optical-acoustic phonon thermal non-equilibrium in supported monolayered WS2 materials by leveraging the distinct thermal response of optical phonons (OPs) and acoustic phonons (APs) under modulated laser excitation of different frequencies. The temperature response of different phonon branches is separated based on the measured Raman shift power coefficient (\u03c8) with high precision. The reduction of the laser spot radius from \u223c1.7 to \u223c0.4 \u03bcm increases the \u03c8OA/\u03c8AP ratio by over 2.5 times, revealing a pronounced enhancement of optical-acoustic phonon thermal non-equilibrium. Comparisons between transferred monolayered WS2 and hetero-bilayered WS2/WSe2 show that the heterogeneous interface strongly strengthens optical to acoustic phonon scattering. In addition, smaller laser spots intensify the hot carrier diffusion effect, reducing the associated OP\u2013AP temperature difference by over 60%. Our method establishes a powerful experimental platform for probing phonon transport in nanoscale materials. Soil organic carbon (SOC) constitutes the largest terrestrial carbon pool and plays a crucial role in climate regulation, soil fertility, and ecosystem functioning. Understanding its spatiotemporal dynamics is particularly important in semi-arid regions, where fragile environments and extensive ecological restoration may alter carbon cycling. The Loess Plateau, the world\u2019s largest loess accumulation area with a history of severe erosion and large-scale vegetation restoration, provides a natural laboratory for examining how environmental gradients influence SOC storage over time. This study used a random forest model with multi-source environmental data to quantify soil organic carbon density (SOCD) dynamics in the 0\u2013100 cm soil layer of the Loess Plateau from 2005 to 2020. SOCD showed strong spatial heterogeneity, decreasing from the humid southeast to the arid northwest. Over the 15-year period, total SOC storage increased from 4.84 to 5.23 Pg C (a 7.9% rise), while the annual sequestration rate declined from 0.046 to 0.020 kg\u00b7m\u22122\u00b7yr\u22121, indicating that the regional carbon sink may be approaching saturation after two decades of restoration. Among soil types, Cambisols were the largest carbon pool, accounting for over 44% of total SOC storage. Vegetation productivity emerged as the dominant driver of SOC variability, with clay content as a secondary factor. These results indicate that although ecological restoration has substantially enhanced SOC storage, its marginal benefits are diminishing. Understanding the spatial and temporal patterns of SOC and their environmental drivers provides essential insights for evaluating long-term carbon sequestration potential and informing future land management strategies. Broader generalization requires multi-regional comparisons, long-term monitoring, and deeper soil investigations to capture ecosystem-scale carbon dynamics fully. Abstract Aqueous Zn\u2010I 2 batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage, exhibit excellent safety, low cost, and high energy density. However, their practical application is limited by the two\u2010electron I \u2212 /I\u2070 redox reaction and the severe shuttle effect of polyiodide species. Here, a multifunctional ionic liquid, 1\u2010butyl\u20103\u2010methylimidazolium bromide (BmimBr), is introduced to establish a dynamic interhalogen coupling between iodine and bromine species, which enables a six\u2010electron transfer pathway involving I \u2212 /I\u2070/I\u207a and Br \u2212 /Br\u2070.

    "research_summary": "Batteries are critical for electrified transportation and aviation, yet thermodynamic understanding of electrode materials remains lacking, as indicated by the often-seen violation of the second law of thermodynamics of open-circuit voltage (OCV) models. On the other hand, thermodynamic modeling rarely utilizes electrochemical data such as OCV, entropic heat (dOCV/dT), which contains rich thermodynamic information. This work introduces a framework of thermodynamic modeling of materials for electrochemical energy storage, using differentiable programming and gradient-based optimization of thermodynamic parameters. Using a modified Debye model that accounts for the phonon density of states, the thermodynamics of pure substances is modeled from experimental measurements of specific heat ($c_p$) as well as the phonon density of states $g(\u03c9)$. Thermodynamics of mixing is modeled with measured entropic heat and OCV data. We demonstrate the differentiable thermodynamic modeling framework with forward and inverse problems. In the forward problem, i.e. determining phase diagram of graphite anode given thermochemical and electrochemical data, we show that in addition to accurate reproduction of phase diagram of LixC6, the fitted temperature-dependent OCV of graphite reaches 3.8 mV mean absolute error (MAE) for test set data measured at 10$^\\circ$C, compared with 2.9-3.6 mV MAE for training set data measured at 25$^\\circ$C - 57$^\\circ$C. In the inverse problem, i.e. determining OCV of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cathode from phase diagram constrained by thermochemical and electrochemical data, we demonstrate accurate reproduction of LFP OCV as well as phase diagram. This framework offers a unified treatment of chemical and electrochemical thermodynamic data for electrode materials. Electrochemical energy storages (EES) are being actively deployed as more renewable energy generation are integrated into the grid infrastructure. Among various EES, Li-ion batteries share more than 80% of EES utilized but reliability and performance have not been clearly evaluated and compared. In this presentation, performance of nine different commercial Li-ion battery cell chemistries under standardized grid duty cycle testing protocols developed by DOE-OE will be presented. The lifecycle derived from capacity, round trip efficiency (RTE), resistance, charge/discharge energy and total utilized energy of the battery chemistries will be compared. Furthermore, effect of aging, frequency regulation (FR), peak shaving (PS) and electric vehicle (EV) drive cycles on degradation mechanisms of different battery chemistries will be discussed. Adoption readiness levels (ARLs) were developed by the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Technology Transitions (OTT) to holistically capture barriers to market adoption for a technology. The framework consists of 17 risk dimensions falling into 4 broad categories: Value Proposition, Market Acceptance, Resource Maturity, and License to Operate. OTT\u2019s Commercial Adoption Readiness Assessment Tool (CARAT) can be used to evaluate a technology\u2019s ARL. This work applies CARAT to redox flow batteries to evaluate the level of risk for this technology class across the 17 dimensions. Redox flow batteries were found to bear 1-2 high risk dimensions, 10-11 medium risk dimensions, 5 low risk dimensions, and scored an overall low readiness on the CARAT scoring scale (ranges reflect variation with flow battery chemistry). Herein, we describe the factors and evaluation across the dimensions leading to this score for redox flow batteries. Iron\u2013nickel (Fe-Ni) batteries are renowned for their durability and resilience against overcharging and operating temperatures. However, they encounter challenges in achieving widespread adoption for energy storage applications due to their low efficiency and the need for regular maintenance and electrolyte replacement, which adds to maintenance costs. This study evaluates and demonstrates the capabilities of Fe-Ni batteries for participating in grid energy storage applications. Stable performance was observed frequency regulation (FR) testing at 100% and 50% state of charge (SOC)s, while at 50% SOC, there was a 14% increase in efficiency compared to 100% SOC. Although 25% SOC achieved higher efficiency, limited cyclability was observed due to reaching the discharge cutoff voltage. Optimal SOC selection, battery monitoring, maintenance, and appropriate charging strategies of Fe-Ni batteries seem to be crucial for their FR applications. Fe-Ni batteries exhibit stable peak shaving (PS) results, indicating their suitability and reliability under various load conditions for PS testing. Extended cycling tests confirm their potential for long-term grid-scale energy storage, enhancing their appeal for PS and FR applications."

    "research_summary": "Abstract The machining performance of AlTiN coated inserts is influenced by the surface condition and mechanical behavior of the coatings. In this paper, AlTiN coatings were deposited by arc evaporation on a series of micro sandblasting (MSB) pre-treated cemented carbide tools under sandblasting pressure from 0 to 0.6 MPa. Under different sandblasting pressures, the surface roughness of the substrate ranged from 0.11 to 0.21 \u03bcm, and the surface material composition underwent significant changes, with the W/Co ratio varying from 8.95 to 13.27. Combined with indentation tests, the sample B15 exhibited delamination, and preliminary analysis indicated that the surface roughness of the substrate has a profound impact on coating adhesion. This article focuses on artificial intelligence to empower the intelligent application of moral and legal education resources, and explores its important role, real challenges and practical paths. Artificial intelligence can promote the \"intelligent integration\", \"dynamic update\" and \"precise push\" of moral and legal education resources, and improve the aggregation, timeliness and adaptability of moral and legal education resources, but face problems such as data processing and resource complexity adaptation difficulties, obstacles to teacher technology integration, and contradictions in student learning needs and resource utilization. To meet these challenges, we can promote the high-quality development of moral and legal education and realize the internalization and practice of moral and legal education results by strengthening the compatibility of artificial intelligence with moral and legal education resources, enhancing teachers' artificial intelligence literacy, and stimulating students' participation."

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT This paper presents the innovative engineering designs of the large\u2010scale shake table specimens for two research projects using the NEES/NHERI@UCSD Large Outdoor Shake Table. The first test building is a three\u2010story diaphragm\u2010sensitive precast structure; the second is a four\u2010story flat plate reinforced concrete structure possessing a novel low\u2010damage seismic system; both structures were constructed at half\u2010scale. Each shake table test program was part of a larger research project involving nominally the same multi\u2010university research team: the Diaphragm Seismic Design Methodology (DSDM) project tasked with developing a new seismic design methodology for precast concrete floor diaphragms; the Inertial Force\u2010Limiting Floor Anchorage System (IFAS) project, which aimed to develop a new low\u2010damage seismic system via a deformable floor connection. Both projects adopted an integration of component physical testing and analytical simulation to develop new knowledge on their research topic and utilized a large\u2010scale shake table test near the project's conclusion to serve as a demonstration and calibration tool. A common theme of these shake table test programs, and the focus of this paper, is the innovative designs of the test structures to maximize the outcomes and value of the test programs by: (1) overcoming testing limitations and extend testing capabilities; (2) testing realistic building structures that better reproduce actual conditions; (3) creating a repeated\u2010use test structure that permits evaluation of multiple design parameters at multiple hazard levels or comparison of two distinct systems; and (4) ensuring safety throughout the entire test program. The required engineering design decisions were inextricably linked to the research objectives. At the scale required for the test buildings, the research team faced challenges in design, component production, erection, and demolition. The performance of these engineering features is presented, and lessons learned are provided. The objective of this paper is to document the engineering innovations underlying these successful shake table test programs to serve as a resource for the earthquake engineering research community planning future large shake table tests. Natural hazards, including hurricanes and earthquakes, can escalate into catastrophic societal events due to the destruction of the built environment. To minimize the impact of such hazards on vulnerable communities, civil infrastructure must be designed with performance criteria that prioritize public safety and ensure continuous operation. The National Science Foundation funded Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) program focuses on advancing the development of resilient infrastructure. The NHERI Lehigh Real-time Multi-directional Simulation Experimental Facility (EF) is one of the facilities within this program. The facility serves as an open-access research hub, offering advanced technologies and engineering tools to develop innovative solutions for natural hazard mitigation. It is uniquely equipped to perform large-scale, multi-directional structural testing in real-time using a cyber-physical simulation technique known as real-time hybrid simulation. This technique enables researchers to model entire systems subjected to dynamic loads at a full scale, allowing for realistic assessments of infrastructure responses to specific hazard scenarios and the development of effective mitigation strategies. This paper explores how cyber-physical simulation has revolutionized research in natural hazards engineering and its influence on engineering practices. It highlights several ongoing projects at the NHERI Lehigh EF aimed at enhancing community resilience in hazard-prone regions. The paper also discusses the planned expansion of the EF, which aims to broaden its focus to include a wider range of natural hazards, and infrastructure systems. This expansion will incorporate both physical and computational resources to enhance the understanding of fluid interactions in combined natural hazards and climate change impacts on coastal and offshore infrastructure. The NHERI Lehigh EF represents a transformative facility that is reshaping natural hazards research and will continue to play a pivotal role in the development of risk management strategies for more resilient communities."

    "research_summary": "Cyanobacterial photosystem I (PSI) can undergo modifications that adjust photosynthetic electron transport in response to fluctuations in environmental and cellular conditions. We recently reported that PSI isolated from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S. 6803) strains lacking a peripheral oxygen reduction reaction (ORR1) pathway demonstrated altered P<sub>700</sub> photooxidation capacity, changes in spectral properties, and a higher proportion of monomers. These changes in PSI were augmented when cells were grown under higher photon flux, which creates a greater energy imbalance at PSI. We have shown that the modified PSI is functional in photochemical charge separation and ferredoxin reduction reactions. Thus, we hypothesized that monomerization of PSI was caused by changes in the environment of PsaL, which is known to be essential for stabilizing trimers. To test our hypothesis, we isolated PSI monomers and trimers from ORR1 and wild-type (WT) strains. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra of reduced PSI demonstrated the presence of intact F<sub>A</sub> and F<sub>B</sub> [4Fe-4S] clusters, consistent with measurements of functional charge separation and electron transport. Limited proteolysis followed by mass spectrometric analysis showed altered accessibility of PsaL in the ORRI PSI monomers compared to WT monomers, and included regions associated with chlorophyll and carotenoid binding, and in functional interactions with adjacent subunits. In addition, ORR1 PSI monomers had spectral changes compared to WT PSI due to differences in carotenoid compositions. Collectively, these findings reveal new insights into how microbes adjust PSI structure and photochemistry to mitigate photodamage in response to changes in electron utilization by downstream chemical reactions. [FeFe]-Hydrogenases are structurally diverse enzymes that catalyze reversible H<sub>2</sub> activation at a catalytic cofactor or H-cluster. The H-cluster is a [4Fe-4S] cubane linked by a cysteine thiolate to a diiron subsite containing unique CO, CN<sup>-</sup>, and dithiomethylamine ligands. The established H-cluster resting state of [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>-[Fe<sup>II</sup>-Fe<sup>I</sup>], or H<sub>ox</sub>, functions in H<sub>2</sub> binding and oxidation, or by proton-coupled reduction initiates H<sub>2</sub> evolution. In contrast, in <i>Clostridium pasteurianum</i> [FeFe]-hydrogenase III (CpIII) the resting state of the H-cluster is fully oxidized, [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>-[Fe<sup>II</sup>-Fe<sup>II</sup>], or H<sub>ox+1</sub>. To begin to understand if H<sub>ox+1</sub> has a role in the mechanism of CpIII, we determined the spectroscopic and redox properties of CpIII H-cluster states under catalytic conditions. CpIII poised in H<sub>ox+1</sub> and either equilibrated under 1 atm of H<sub>2</sub> or reduced with sodium dithionite, resulted in a mixture of reduced states including H<sub>ox</sub> (<i>E</i><sub>m</sub><sup>8</sup> = -407 mV), H<sub>trans</sub>-like [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup>-[Fe<sup>II</sup>-Fe<sup>II</sup>] (<i>E</i><sub>m</sub><sup>8</sup> = -418 mV), H<sub>red</sub> [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup>-[Fe<sup>II</sup>-Fe<sup>I</sup>], and H<sub>redH+</sub> [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup>-[Fe<sup>I</sup>-Fe<sup>I</sup>] (<i>E</i><sub>m</sub><sup>8</sup> = -455-480 mV). Under H<sub>2</sub> the population of the H<sub>trans</sub>-like state was >20-fold higher than H<sub>ox</sub>, implicating a role in CpIII catalysis. Unlike other enzymes, there was no spectral evidence of fully reduced states, such as H<sub>sredH+</sub> ([4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup>-[Fe<sup>I</sup>-Fe<sup>I</sup>]) or H<sub>hyd</sub> ([4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup>-[Fe<sup>II-</sup>Fe<sup>II</sup>]-H<sup>-</sup>). Thus, while the H-cluster states of CpIII encompass most of the catalytic intermediates, it is either unable to form H<sub>sredH+</sub> and H<sub>hyd</sub>, or these states are highly destabilized in CpIII. Thus, these results demonstrate that catalytic intermediates of reduced CpIII differ from the typical intermediates of other catalytic [FeFe]-hydrogenases and may explain the catalytic preference for H<sub>2</sub> production."

    "research_summary": "Road transport constitutes a crucial element of the European economy, but it also generates significant external costs. In the process of reducing the impact of road transport on the environment and society, numerous actions are being undertaken to implement the concept of sustainable transport development in the Member States of the European Union. A key measure in this area is the introduction of low- and zero-emission propulsion systems in vehicles intended for passenger and freight transport. This article focuses on electric vehicles powered by battery energy storage systems. An essential component of these efforts is the development of alternative fuels infrastructure, which is expected to enable the operation of such vehicles by providing access to battery charging facilities. The development of infrastructure in the form of electric vehicle charging stations, initially concentrated in urban areas, has been extended to the network of European roads. The driving force behind this expansion is the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, which, on the basis of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR), stimulate the development of alternative fuels infrastructure along the TEN-T network. The aim of the article is to present selected challenges related to the electrification of road transport infrastructure in the context of the sustainable transport development concept and the construction of alternative fuels infrastructure along the TEN-T network. The research focuses on forecasting the demand for alternative fuels infrastructure along the A1 and A2 motorways, which form part of the TEN-T network within the territory of Poland. The research process stems from the implementation of the AFIR in the EU Member States. Abstract. Mesoscale simulations are increasingly used to estimate wake effects within and between large wind farms, despite limited validation for large-scale wake effects. This study evaluates the capabilities and limitations of mesoscale simulations in capturing wake-induced impacts on wind turbine power production through a direct comparison with large-domain large-eddy simulations (LES) for three planned offshore wind farms under realistic atmospheric conditions and a range of atmospheric stabilities. We assess mesoscale performance in replicating wake characteristics behind single and multiple turbine clusters and quantify the resulting variability in mean turbine power. Results show that mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting simulations with the Fitch wind farm parameterization capture key features of the velocity deficit downstream of both single and multiple wind farms, with mean root-mean-square errors near 5 % and good agreement with stability-driven wake behavior. However, in these simulations, the mesoscale Fitch parameterization underestimates power losses from internal wake effects, particularly when turbines align with the prevailing wind direction or under stable stratification. In these conditions, individual wakes persist and dominate downstream power deficits. The coarse resolution of the mesoscale simulations limits their ability to resolve individual wind turbine wakes that drive power fluctuations within wind farms. Nonetheless, mesoscale simulations can yield accurate estimates of combined wake losses from internal and cluster effects across some wind direction sectors, where errors in wake representation may cancel out. These findings underscore the strengths of mesoscale simulations for capturing broader wake patterns, while highlighting their limitations for modeling turbine-level power losses. Future work should explore hybrid modeling approaches to capture both long-range cluster wake propagation and localized internal wake dynamics. Abstract. This study seeks to advance our understanding of energy losses caused by wind farm cluster wakes off the U.S. East Coast by utilizing advanced numerical models in conjunction with real-world, available data on existing and planned offshore wind sites. To this end, we have run simulations of existing and planned U.S. offshore wind lease areas using a typical-meteorological-year approach with a GPU-based Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, where lease area layouts are generated based on most up-to-date project capacity information for each individual lease areas. To evaluate wake losses, we use an energy-loss-based definition of \"wake shadow\", as opposed to the traditional wind speed deficit assessment. A key insight from this study is that large wind speed deficits do not necessarily translate into significant energy losses. In addition, our results indicate that the conventional wind speed deficit method may underestimate the size of the wake area by up to 30 % compared to the proposed energy loss approach. These findings highlight the need to consider both wind speed deficits and energy losses when evaluating the wake effects of offshore wind farms and assessing future offshore wind develop"

    "research_summary": "<title>Abstract</title> Oysters are ecosystem engineers that restructure their environments through intense filtration and reef-building, known for their ability to remove plankton and particulates from seawater. As microbialization and eutrophication increasingly undermine coastal water quality, understanding how oyster filtration shapes viral and microbial assemblages is essential to evaluate its role in countering these degradation processes. Here, we incubated the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, in natural seawater and conducted a high-resolution 24-hour time-series analysis to track changes in viral and microbial abundances. Oysters preferentially removed autotrophic microbes, skewing community composition toward heterotrophy and altering local carbon and energy fluxes. Understanding the extent to which viral and microbial components contribute to oyster nutrition could provide new insights into these shifts and their broader ecological consequences. Viral abundances displayed Lotka\u2013Volterra-like oscillations, suggesting that phage replication was sustained through lytic cycling rather than integration into microbial genomes, even under reduced microbial availability. Elevated virus-to-microbe ratios (VMRs) in oyster-associated mucus compared to ambient seawater points to a role of bacteriophage adherence-to-mucus (BAM) in modulating host-microbiome interactions within the oyster holobiont. Together, these findings highlight oysters as ecosystem de-microbializers and holobiont viralizers, simultaneously suppressing water-column microbes and stimulating localized viral activity that reshapes microbial interactions and coastal biogeochemistry. ABSTRACT The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are a biodiversity hotspot, largely due to the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) which supplies nutrient\u2010rich waters to the euphotic zone and supports enhanced levels of primary productivity performed by phytoplankton. Understanding phytoplankton responses to changing environmental conditions is crucial for regional conservation and management efforts. Research cruises conducted between 2014 and 2022, spanning a major El Ni\u00f1o event in 2015 and a La Ni\u00f1a event in 2022, observed varying oceanic conditions and diverse phytoplankton community composition. At most EUC\u2010influenced stations, larger\u2010sized phytoplankton groups (\u2265 5 \u03bcm) were dominant while warmer, oligotrophic sites favoured smaller\u2010sized phytoplankton groups (&lt; 5 \u03bcm). Predictably, nutrient supply was suppressed during the El Ni\u00f1o event associated with the weakening of the EUC and deepening of the thermocline. Counterintuitively, nutrient levels were not significantly enhanced during the La Ni\u00f1a event likely because increased stratification between the mixed and deep water layers reduced entrainment, particularly at Eastern stations. Protist community composition was evaluated using 18S rRNA gene metabarcoding; the majority of detected OTUs were associated with upwelling conditions prevalent around the archipelago. Taxonomic variability reflected heterogeneous environmental conditions generated by the convergence of multiple ocean currents. These results highlight the dynamic interplay of physical and biological factors shaping primary productivity in the Gal\u00e1pagos marine ecosystem. Historically, oceanographic time-series have focused on long-term measurements of large open ocean gyres; yet, the coastal oceans, with their high productivity, tidal impacts, human feedbacks, and land-sea coupling, represent critical regions for predicting ocean dynamics and biogeochemistry under global change. The Piver\u2019s Island Coastal Observatory (PICO) time-series, located in the second largest estuarine system on the US East Coast (Albemarle-Pamlico Sound), comprises more than a decade of weekly (or more frequent) measurements of core physical, chemical, and biological oceanographic variables. PICO provides insight into a coastal, mesotrophic ecosystem in an ecologically-diverse and biochemically-active region impacted by global change. Here, we report on a decade of observations focusing on pulse and press ecosystem changes. We observe strong mean annual cycles in environmental variables including temperature (10.1-28.9\u00b0C), pH (7.89-8.12), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC: 1965 \u2013 2088 \u00b5M), chlorophyll (2.54-5.77 mg Chl m -3 ), upon which are layered episodic disturbances (e.g., tropical cyclones) that dramatically and persistently (&amp;gt;1 month) impact this ecosystem. Among other variables, long term trends in pH (-0.004 \u00b1 0.001 y -1 ; p&amp;lt;0.01), DIC (-9.8 \u00b1 1.5 \u00b5M y -1 ; p&amp;lt;0.01) and chlorophyll (-0.17 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5g L -1 y -1 ; p&amp;lt;0.01) are exceeding those observed in the open ocean, suggesting an ecosystem in flux. These analyses provide a benchmark for future studies of the impact of changing climate and oceanographic climatology; further research will use this long-term research to developed targeted sampling and experimental manipulations to better understand ecosyste"

    "research_summary": "The Utah State University has been developing a compact IR spectrometer for atmospheric methane measurements called FINIS. FINIS is a binocular imager with narrowband interference filters placed at the entrance of each optical assembly with a tilted angle. The filter's center wavelength dependency with the angle of incidence allows for a highly efficient light dispersion across the focal plane. The spectrum across the 1658-1668nm wavelength window is acquired as the ground samples cross the field of view. The methane concentration is computed using an inversion method, combining measurements from both optical systems to enhance the overall signal-to-noise ratio. This paper presents an overview of the tilted interference filter technique as well as the methane retrieval performance considering the instrument's design parameters. The GLO instrument concept is a VNIR/MWIR solar occultation sensor designed to measure (all at < 1 km vertical resolution) O3, H2O, CH4, CO, HF, HCN, HCl, HDO, N2O, CO2 (for temperature), and aerosol from orbital altitudes. The vertical measurement range spans the entire middle atmosphere, but the sensor has been designed to particularly target transport and composition in the UTLS. With its small form factor and modest spacecraft requirements, GLO is well suited for constellation applications. We will describe one such implementation of GLO. The instrument concept, measurement and data acquisition approach, and potential applications will be discussed. Abstract The glycosyltransferase 64 (GT64) family includes members from a diverse range of species including human, Xenopus and Drosophila as well as plant species including Arabidopsis, the moss Physcomitrella and poplar. The majority of the animal GT64 proteins are bimodular, consisting of an N\u2010terminal GT47 domain linked to a GT64 domain. The animal GT64 domain has been found to have GlcNAc transferase activity and functions during heparan sulphate biosynthesis. However, the biochemical activity of the plant GT64 proteins has yet to be established. Arabidopsis has three GT64 members which have been named ECTOPICALLY PARTING CELLS1 (EPC1), EPC\u2010LIKE1 (EPC\u2010L1) and EPC\u2010LIKE2 (EPC\u2010L2). The EPC1 and EPC\u2010L1 proteins are comprised of a single GT64 domain whereas the EPC\u2010L2 protein has an additional N\u2010terminal domain which does not show homology to any other protein other than EPC\u2010L2 homologues from other plants. Mutation of the Arabidopsis GT64 EPC1 results in a plant with severely reduced stature, demonstrating the importance of its function for normal plant development. Neutral sugar analysis of the epc1 cell wall shows a reduction in galactose but there is currently no enzymatic activity demonstrated to explain this alteration. In contrast to EPC1, EPC\u2010L2 is specifically expressed in reproductive tissues and mutations in the gene result in defects in pollen development, reduced seed formation and embryo abortions at the late globular stage."

    "research_summary": "Fast pyrolysis of biomass results in a pyrolytic oil which is a mixture of (a) carbohydrate-derived acids, aldehydes and polyols, (b) lignin-derived substituted phenolics, and (c) extractives-derived terpenoids and fatty acids. The conversion of this pyrolysis oil into H{sub 2} and CO{sub 2} is thermodynamically favored under appropriate steam reforming conditions. Our efforts have focused in understanding the catalysis of steam reforming which will lead to a successful process at reasonable steam/carbon ratios arid process severities. The experimental work, carried out at the laboratory and bench scale levels, has centered on the performance of Ni-based catalysts using model compounds as prototypes of the oxygenates present in the pyrolysis oil. Steam reforming of acetic acid, hydroxyacetaldehyde, furfural and syringol has been proven to proceed rapidly within a reasonable range of severities. Time-on-stream studies are now underway using a fixed bed barometric pressure reactor to ascertain the durability of the catalysts and thus substantiate the scientific and technical feasibility of the catalytic reforming option. Economic analyses are being carried out in parallel to determine the opportunity zones for the combined fast pyrolysis/steam reforming approach. A discussion on the current state of the project is presented. Gels are cross-linked networks of polymers swollen with a liquid. Two-thirds of the human body consists of water, and almost all known biological reactions occur in water. The ability of polysaccharides to form a network structure, even at very low concentrations, constitutes one of their most important functional properties. Many natural and bacterial polysaccharides, charged or uncharged, form three-dimensional networks under specific conditions. Cross-linking is one of the oldest methods for the chemical modification of polymers. Various degrees of cross-linking can be introduced into polysaccharides for the purpose of generating larger molecular aggregates with enhanced viscosity profiles, or for the preparation of insoluble products with a wide range of swelling characteristics. Reaction of polysaccharides with epichlorohydrin usually leads to cross-linking, but monofunctional side reactions may also occur to form a series of by-products with glycolic functional groups.

Enerkem Inc. is a leading biomass gasification company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. The approach Enerkem has been developing involves: identification of low cost residual streams as feedstock, sorting, biotreatment (anaerobic and/or aerobic) and preparation of an ultimate residue (RDF). The latter is a rather uniform material that can be fed, as a fluff, to a bubbling bed gasifier in a staged gasification to carry out, sequentially, the needed chemical reactions that result in high syngas yields. Process can be adjusted to reach desired gas composition for synthesis or electricity generation as well as gas conditioning to produce an ultraclean syngas. Products for such a process are: i) syngas with an appropriate range of H2/CO ratios, ii) CO2 (which is recovered), iii) solid char as a residue composed of the inorganic fraction of the raw material and some unconverted carbon that \u201ccoats\u201d the inorganic matrices, and"

    "research_summary": "We have synthesized a family of styryl-based molecules that have been attached to nickel oxide films using a novel ethoxysilane chemistry to modify the work function over a range of 900 meV. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of poly(benzodithiophene-thienopyrrolodione) (BDT-TPD) oligomers in order to evaluate the accuracy with which unoptimized molecular models can predict experimentally characterized morphologies. The predicted morphologies are characterized using simulated grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) and compared to the experimental scattering patterns. We find that approximating the aromatic rings in BDT-TPD with rigid bodies, rather than combinations of bond, angle, and dihedral constraints, results in 14% lower computational cost and provides nearly equivalent structural predictions compared to the flexible model case. The predicted glass transition temperature of BDT-TPD (410 \u00b1 32 K) is found to be in agreement with experiments. Predicted morphologies demonstrate short-range structural order due to stacking of the chain backbones (\u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking around 3.9 \u00c5), and long-range spatial correlations due to the self-organization of backbone stacks into \u201cribbons\u201d (lamellar ordering around 20.9 \u00c5), representing the best-to-date computational predictions of structure of complex conjugated oligomers. We find that expensive simulated annealing schedules are not needed to predict experimental structures here, with instantaneous quenches providing nearly equivalent predictions at a fraction of the computational cost of annealing. We therefore suggest utilizing rigid bodies and fast cooling schedules for high-throughput screening studies of semiflexible polymers and oligomers to utilize their significant computational benefits where appropriate.

    "research_summary": "Abstract Woven/unidirectional (UD) curved hybrid laminates have been widely applied in aerospace and automotive fields due to their excellent mechanical properties and design flexibility. The laser-assisted thermoplastic composite automated fiber placement has the advantages of fast forming speed and high heating efficiency. This study focuses on investigating the low-velocity impact behavior of glass fiber/polypropylene woven/UD composite curved hybrid laminates prepared by automated fiber placement molding. The automated fiber placement molded curved hybrid laminates were compared with those on UD laminates via automated fiber placement and woven/UD laminates molded by the autoclave process. Impact responses of specimens were determined through low-velocity impact tests with impact energies of 15 J, 20 J and 25 J. After the low-velocity impact tests, the damage to specimens was characterized and analyzed using a super-depth-of-field microscope. Also, the low-velocity impact damage behavior of the three types of specimens is quantitatively compared by using the impact contact force, impact peak force and absorbed impact energy. It is concluded that the layer structure plays an important role in determining the low-velocity impact behavior of composite laminates. Especially for GF/PP woven/UD curved hybrid laminates prepared by automated fiber placement, the woven layer plays an important role in reducing matrix cracking, delamination and fiber fracture, thus improving its low-velocity impact resistance. The general basis of diabetes prediction using machine learning involves the application of algorithms that take an overall look at multiple features like BMI and glucose levels, age, genetic predispositions, and other conditions that may predict the likelihood of developing diabetes. The data-driven schemes, such as neural networks or DTs, find patterns in past data and use these to provide reliable predictions about future diabetes cases. These schemes keep learning and improving; they grow with new inputs. ML now helps in early detection by the use of large datasets, thus enabling early actions such as lifestyle changes or medical therapies. Finally, it enhances healthcare by providing individualized risk assessment and thus enables timely actions to diminish the burden of diabetes. In addition, the application of ML schemes, including Gaussian Process Classification-GPC, Linear Discriminant Analysis-LDA with Henry Gas Solubility Optimization-HGSO, Chaos Game Optimization-CGO, and Chef-Based Enhancement scheme-CBOA, has greatly benefited the process of prediction. These schemes were combined with optimizers, guided by the objective of this work, which deals with predicting the type of diabetes and the diagnosis of persons vulnerable to it. This was a strategic fusion aimed at creating new hybrid schemes with increased precision in prediction. Further analysis showed that the GPCB model was the best, with an impressive 0.981 during training. By contrast, the GPCG and GPHG schemes are relatively less accurate, with an accuracy of 0.963 and 0.946, respectively. These results justify the utility of the integrated approach, where advanced ML algorithms were able to generate predictive schemes superior in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to the classical methods."

    "research_summary": "Abstract. We quantify the accuracy of the temperature profiling from ground-based spectral infrared radiance observations at AWAKEN. Results from pre-campaign tests and comparisons with in-situ ground-based and airborne sensors at AWAKEN indicate that temperature profiles agree satisfactorily with traditional instruments for wind energy applications. The bias is within a fraction of a degree and appears to be related to atmospheric stability. Root-mean-square differences from the reference instruments are always smaller than a degree and are often well described by the online uncertainty estimation product. Height-to-height and site-to-site temperature differences are in excellent agreement with in-situ observations, which justifies the use of temperature profilers to characterize static stability and spatial gradients of temperature. Many real-world phenomena corrupt light detection and ranging (lidar) measurements, such as laser energy attenuation, variations in aerosol concentration and composition with height, and hard target returns. Accurate studies of lidar scans using virtual lidar methods should include some realistic model of these corrupting effects to generate more realistic simulations of lidar scans. We present a simple model that characterizes noise caused by energy attenuation and aerosol stratification. The model requires limited inputs and is developed for a Halo Photonics Streamline XR lidar but is readily generalizable for other lidar systems. A critical component of this model is a model of the standard deviation of measured wind speed as a function of the backscattered signal\u2019s signal-to-noise ratio. We derive a general model for this behavior that can be adapted to different scan settings. Abstract. As wind energy deployment grows, interactions between wind plants and the surrounding environment become more prevalent. The current investigation seeks to understand these interactions by characterizing the impact of wind plants on the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), utilizing observations from the American WAKE experimeNt (AWAKEN) campaign. Given the ambiguity of the definition of PBLH under stable atmospheric conditions, where the impact of wind plants is expected to be strongest, a comparison of different methods for identifying PBLH is first conducted using data collected by multiple types of instruments. The Heffter method is selected as the thermodynamic method because it generates the most consistent results for the radiosonde and infrared spectrometer. A minimum vertical velocity variance method is used for a turbulence-based definition. Using both of these methods, the values of PBLH measured at spatially distributed sites are compared under a range of atmospheric conditions. Both methods show a clear increase in PBLH downstream of a wind plant for stable conditions. These impacts are strongest when the upstream PBLH is shallow (less than 0.25 km), with the thermodynamic method showing a PBLH increase of 35 %\u201339 % and the turbulence-based method showing a 143 % increase. At a site 20 km downstream of the wind plant, these effects are no longer observed, suggesting PBLH is not influenced by the wind plant at this distance. The results of this investigation show that wind plants can modify PBLH in their vicinity. As PBLH is a key parameter for numerical models, this insight into wind plant\u2013atmosphere interactions can be used to validate and improve the accuracy of wind energy forecasts."

    "research_summary": "A presentation that describes the technology, costs and trends, and future development of wind energy technologies. When building a wind turbine, you want to make it as tall as possible to capture stronger, faster winds aloft. But taller tower bases become too large to be transported over the road\u2014a constraint that has kept average U.S. wind turbine heights at 80 meters for the last 10 years. A Lab-Corps project undertaken by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory has found a potential solution: automated concrete manufacturing. Boulder Wind Power (BWP) collaborated with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, to demonstrate the economics of scaling an advanced gearless drivetrain technology to 6MW (and larger) turbine applications. The project goal was to show that this advanced drivetrain technology enables a cost of energy of less than $0.10/kWH in offshore applications. This drivetrain technology achieves this Cost of Energy (COE) advantage via a 70% greater torque density versus current state-of-the-art drivetrain technologies. In addition, a new dynamically compliant design strategy is required to optimize turbine system-level COE. The BWP generator is uniquely suited for this new design strategy. This project developed a concept design for a 6MW drivetrain and culminated in a plan for a system-level test of this technology at 3MW scale. The project further demonstrated the advantage of the BWP drivetrain with increasing power ratings, with conceptual designs through 10 MW. This report will present the wind turbine drivetrain condition monitoring (CM) research conducted under the phase 1 and phase 2 Gearbox Reliability Collaborative (GRC) tests. The rationale and approach for this drivetrain CM research, investigated CM systems, test configuration and results, and a discussion on challenges in wind turbine drivetrain CM and future research and development areas, will be presented. This report describes the Gearbox Reliability Collaborative's work at NREL to increase the reliability of wind turbine gearboxes."

    "research_summary": "Our meta-analysis reveals a high PM burden in high- malaria transmission areas, especially among primigravidae and HIV-positive women. We note that PM remains high in SSA, with regional variation, with one in four pregnant women diagnosed by histological examination of the placenta, reflecting both current and past PM exposure. Reliance on non-histological methods may lead to underestimation of true PM prevalence. Due to wide confidence intervals and limited data, we could draw no conclusions on the impact of PM on maternal and foetal outcomes. Residual high heterogeneity reflects real-world diversity across populations, strengthening the generalisability of our findings. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease characterized by memory loss and other cognitive functions. The key hallmarks of AD include extracellular beta-amyloid clumps and intracellular neurofibrillary tau tangles in the neurons. Cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA-receptor antagonists and their combination are already approved treatments; however, these only give short-term symptom relief. Therefore, new therapeutic techniques and novel drugs are required to combat the century-old AD. This study includes the screening of nine novel small compounds (spiro-indenoquinoxaline-pyrrolidines) via <i>in silico</i> approaches; these compounds have been scrutinized to explore their potential as antiamyloidogenic drugs. Computational tools, including ADMET analysis, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have been used for screening the selected compounds against monomeric peptides of A\u03b2 (A\u03b2<sub>1-40</sub> and A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>) and their oligomeric counterparts, i.e., 6A\u03b2<sub>9-40</sub> and 6A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub>. Among the nine molecules screened for this study, ADPR-d reflected the best drug-likeness and negligible toxicity. Further, ADPR-d has the highest binding affinity for all the peptides selected for this study. Additionally, MD simulations of A\u03b2 peptide-ADPR-d complexes confirmed a stable complex formation. <i>In vitro</i> aggregation assay and cell culture studies for A\u03b2<sub>1-42</sub> also support our <i>in silico</i> findings. The positive findings of the presented study highlight that the ADPR-d molecule may prove to be a potential therapeutic molecule against AD. However, these results would require further <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> analysis before proceeding to clinical settings with these compounds against AD. Background: Co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 and HIV presents unique chal-lenges for patients, including potential barriers to accessing care and social support. In the present case report, an unexpected revelation of HIV status was made in an asymptomatic individual who was concurrently infected with SARS-CoV-2. There is insufficient infor-mation on asymptomatic but SARS-CoV-2-positive carriers, who have been identified only because of contact tracing and surveillance. Asymptomatic individuals co-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and HIV pose a significant challenge, not only for the patients and their families, but also for the broader community, highlighting the need for enhanced aware-ness, testing, and contact tracing strategies. Case presentation: This study reports a case of a routine surveillance-based asymptomatic patient who was consistently SARS-CoV-2 positive from June to August 2021 by real-time PCR. Clinical investigations revealed that all vital parameters and laboratory tests were within normal limits, except for a notable elevation in D-dimer levels. The patient was vaccinated with two doses of Covishield, with the second dose administered during the quarantine period. The patient was followed up after six months, and we came to know that the patient\u2019s condition deteriorated in the month of November 2021, and he was tested HIV positive during his admission to a tertiary care hospital. Later on, he died in March 2022. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting accidental finding of HIV in a SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic patient who was previously false negative. The persis-tence of SARS-CoV-2 in this case highlights the importance of comprehensive diagnostic workups and careful clinical management in patients with co-infections. This report also highlights the high risk of silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by asymptomatic individu-als, emphasizing the need to include such cases in dynamic surveillance strategies to pre-vent further spread. Along with this, the study highlights the need for further investigation into the interplay between HIV co-infection, COVID-19 vaccination outcomes, and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 shedding."

    "research_summary": "<ns3:p> Background: After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it spread to 213 countries in 2020. In Indonesia there were 6,812,127 cases, which ranked 20 <ns3:sup>th</ns3:sup> worldwide in the year 2024. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19 with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods This was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior to agreeing or declining to voluntarily participate in the questionnaire-based study. A total of 1,153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death (aOR: 2.502; 95% CI: 1.601-3.912) was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years (aOR: 0.486; 95% CI: 0.254-0.932) were 49% less likely to consistently use masks. Knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours (aOR: 1.697; 95% CI: 1.118-2.576); the transmission (aOR: 1.974; 95%CI: 1.040-3.746), knowledge of severe symptoms of COVID-19 (aOR: 1.981; 95%CI: 1.175-3.342); and awareness of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR (aOR: 2.238; 95%CI: 1.215-4.120) were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of COVID-19 as potentially fatal and knowledge regarding proper mask-changing intervals, the transmission, severe symptoms, and PCR-based diagnosis were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. However, individuals aged between 25 to 44 years were less likely to wear mask consistently. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures. </ns3:p> <ns3:p> Background After the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic which spread to 213 countries in 2020, Indonesia ranked 20 <ns3:sup>th</ns3:sup> for morbidity with a mortality rate of 2.3%, higher than the global rate of 1.1%. In response, Indonesia issued a policy mandating mask use. This study aims to investigate the association between risk perception, sociodemographic factors, and knowledge of COVID-19, with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Methods It was an online study conducted from November 2020 to February 2021, during the first wave of COVID-19. Participants were provided written informed consent prior if agree/reject to completing participate the questionnaire study voluntarily. A total of 1153 respondents were selected. The dependent variable was consistent mask-wearing outside the home, while the independent variables were risk perception regarding COVID-19, sociodemographic factors (location, age, gender, education, occupation, family income, family members, social health scheme), and knowledge of COVID-19. Data were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Results The risk perception of COVID-19 as a viral disease that can cause death aOR: 2.502 was positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Regarding sociodemographic factor, individuals age between 25 to 44 years aOR: 0.486. While, knowledge of the need to change cloth masks every 4-6 hours aOR: 1.686; the transmission aOR: 1.974, the severe symptoms of COVID-19 aOR: 1.981; and of the confirmed diagnosis by PCR aOR: 2.238 were positively associated with consistent mask-wearing outside the home. Conclusions The risk perception of potential fatality COVID-19 and knowledge of proper time to change cloth mask, the transmission, the severe symptom, and the confirmation of COVID-19 testing were positively associated with mask-wearing outside the home. While, age between 25 to 44 years was negatively associated. These findings underscore the importance of targeted public health interventions that address risk perception and enhance knowledge to promote mask use as effective COVID-19 prevention measures. </ns3:p> Tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT) aims to prevent latent TB infection (LTBI) from progressing to active tuberculosis. The WHO recommends TPT for children under five who are exposed to TB patients. In Surabaya City, TPT coverage among child contacts of TB patients was very low, at 1.7% (2020), 4.8% (2021), and 2.6% (2022). This study assesses the readiness of TPT services for children with LTBI living in the same household as TB patients. An observational study with a cross-sectional design was conducted"

    "research_summary": "The data quality activities list may be used in Canadian IPAC surveillance activities to support or improve existing surveillance data quality activities for IPAC programs. Abstract Objective: To describe trends in the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) and antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in Canadian acute-care hospitals. Design: Repeated point prevalence surveys. Setting: Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) hospitals. Methods: Trained infection control professionals reviewed medical records of eligible adult patients and applied standardized definitions to collect demographic data and information on HAIs, AROs, and additional precautions from 39 to 62 hospitals in 2002, 2009, 2017, and 2024. Results: The prevalence of adult patients with at least one HAI increased from 10.4% (95% CI: 9.6%\u201311.2%) in 2002 to 12.4% (95% CI: 11.7%\u201313.2%) in 2009, declined to 8.4% (95% CI: 7.8%\u20139.0%) in 2017, and stabilized in 2024 (8.1%, 95% CI: 7.6%\u20138.6%) despite 3.1% of HAIs being due to SARS-CoV-2. Between 2017 and 2024, there were increases in bloodstream infections (1.0% to 1.5%, p = 0.002), viral respiratory infections (VRI) (0.3% to 0.6%, p &lt; 0.001), and in the prevalence of patients on additional precautions for carbapenemase-producing organisms (0.1% to 1.7%, p &lt; 0.001) and VRIs (2.1% to 3.6%, p &lt; 0.001). In 2024, AROs were responsible for 6.6% of infections. One-third of HAIs were device-associated, and the prevalence of central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs) doubled from 0.4% in 2017 to 0.7% in 2024, p = 0.02. Conclusions: A point prevalence survey performed in Canada in 2024 following the COVID-19 pandemic identified a stable prevalence of HAIs and AROs despite the inclusion of SARS-CoV-2. Concerning trends were observed including the increased prevalence of certain HAIs such as CLABSIs and VRIs highlighting the need for ongoing efforts in hospital infection prevention. Background: Our understanding of health care\u2013associated infection (HAI), antimicrobial resistant organism (ARO), and antimicrobial use (AMU) surveillance activities across Canadian long-term care homes (LTCHs) is limited, in part because nationwide surveillance in this setting has yet to be established. Methods: To address this knowledge gap, the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program administered a 12-item cross-sectional survey to LTCHs across all provinces and territories in English and French. LTCHs were defined as government-licensed homes for individuals with medical needs who require 24-hour onsite access to registered nurse care and/or treatment. Results: Between June 1 and November 28, 2023, 770 of an estimated 2,076 LTCHs responded to the survey (37%). Of the respondents, 41% (318/770) were publicly funded, 67% (504/758) had between 51 and 200 long-term care beds, and 92% (694/758) reported having a designated person who leads infection prevention and control. The majority of LTCHs reported conducting outbreak surveillance (680/713, 95%) and surveillance for at least one type of HAI (672/740, 91%). The most common HAIs under surveillance were urinary tract infection (576/725, 79%), Clostridioides difficile infection (546/725, 75%), and gastroenteritis (545/725, 75%). Half of the LTCHs reported testing new residents for AROs via pre-admission or admission cultures (368/713, 52%). Almost two-thirds (441/703, 63%) reported monitoring systemic antibiotic use. Conclusions: Despite differences in the scope of surveillance activities, mechanisms to measure the burden of HAIs and AROs in this setting exist and may provide the foundation for future national surveillance activities. Generalizability to all Canadian LTCHs is uncertain due to possible sampling, non-response, and social desirability biases."

    "research_summary": "Summary: Background and aims: Protein energy wasting (PEW) is a syndrome of adverse nutritional changes common to chronic kidney disease patients. Handgrip strength (HGS) is a method to screen PEW as mentioned in the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative Guidelines. However, determining the validity of such method requires further and more thorough studies. This study, therefore, aims to determine the diagnostic validity of HGS in detecting PEW among patients on MHD. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 143 randomly-selected patients on MHD in a Philippine tertiary government specialty hospital from September to October, 2022 was conducted. Diagnosis of PEW was based on the Malnutrition Inflammation Score \u22655. HGS was measured using a dynamometer pre- and post-hemodialysis sessions. Results: The prevalence of PEW among the included patients was 53.15% (95% CI: 44.89\u201361.24%). The majority were <60 years old and were males, with a median dialysis vintage of 24 months. The most common comorbidity was hypertension, and hypertensive nephrosclerosis was the most common kidney disease etiology. HGS measured pre-hemodialysis (AUC: 0.77) and post-hemodialysis (AUC: 0.76) showed acceptable discriminative ability detecting PEW regardless of patient sex. Among males, both pre-hemodialysis (cutoff: <16.3, sensitivity: 64%, specificity: 86%) and post-hemodialysis (cutoff: <17.9, sensitivity: 71%, specificity: 74%) HGS measures showed acceptable diagnostic value parameters. However, in females, only the pre-hemodialysis HGS measure was acceptable (cutoff: <18.6, sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 65%). Although post-hemodialysis specificity was 88%, sensitivity was only 50%. Conclusion: The diagnostic performance of HGS in detecting PEW was found to be acceptable. While both pre- and post-hemodialysis measures can be used in males, only the pre-hemodialysis measures are recommended for females. HGS can be used as an objective, accurate and inexpensive screening assessment tool in detecting PEW for patients on MHD. GI manifestation was common among ESRD patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19. The inhospital mortality rate is also high; however, GI manifestation was not associated with this outcome. Meanwhile, GI manifestation leads to longer hospital stay. Patients with ESRD and COVID-19 showed a high in-hospital mortality rate. Older age, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, encephalopathy, and intubation increased the odds of mortality. Meanwhile, males had lower odds of mortality than females. Complications after closed tube thoracostomy are common. Across all variables analyzed, only indication of chest tube insertion, operative time, and occurrence of chest tube failure were found to differ between patients with and without complications. Moreover, patients with complications had longer length of stay than those without. Reducing positional tube complications may help decrease in-hospital morbidity. Background Scalp arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a rare congenital disease that may present with massive bleeding. To date, surgical excision remains the definitive management. However, the procedure could lead to intraoperative bleeding due to the tumor\u2019s high blood flow and complex vascularity. Case Report A 49-year old Filipino male presented with a bleeding giant scalp AVM. Computed tomographic scan and duplex studies showed multiple feeding vessels with turbulent flow arising primarily from the right superficial temporal, right posterior auricular, and occipital vessels. Prior to surgery, the patient underwent transfusion due to preoperative hemoglobin of 6 g/dL. Proximal control of the right external carotid artery was performed through a supine position and left in place to reduce the majority of blood flow to the AVM. The patient was turned to a prone position for surgical planning to achieve maximal skin-sparing dissection prior to excision. First, ligation of bilateral superficial temporal and posterior auricular arteries was performed. Next, excision above the periosteum with segmental ligation of feeding vessels around the AVM was carried out. Reconstruction of the defect was done via scalp advancement flap and split-thickness skin grafting. Intraoperative blood loss was 1.6 L. On the sixth postoperative day, the patient was discharged with 100% graft take. Conclusion Management of scalp AV malformation is challenging, and despite measures to decrease intraoperative bleeding, blood loss is still high. While preoperative embolization has been reported to decrease the risk of bleeding, this procedure is not currently available in our setting. Our case highlights the complexity of giant scalp AV malformation management in a limited-resource setting. Even in the absence of endovascular intervention, outright surgical excision of AVM can be performed, albeit with higher levels of blood loss."

    "research_summary": "Mpox is a reemerging zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV) and continues to pose a serious global health challenge. In January 2025, Sierra Leone confirmed its first case in the Western Area Rural district, which marked a significant moment in the nation\u2019s public health response. This report describes the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory investigation of the index case, a 27-year-old male from Hamilton, as well as the actions taken to contain the disease. A rapid response team (RRT) was activated following World Health Organization (WHO) protocols, including the use of WHO case investigation forms, line-listing of cases and contacts, laboratory confirmation using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), genomic sequencing, contact tracing, isolation of high-risk contacts, daily monitoring for 21 days, risk communication, and community engagement. The patient was confirmed to have mpox clade IIb and recovered fully after isolation and medical care. Nine close contacts were identified, monitored for 21 days, and none developed symptoms. Although the exact source of infection was not identified and the findings suggest possible links to close human contact and recent travel during the incubation period. This case emphasizes the importance of early detection, effective surveillance, timely isolation, and clear communication in responding to emerging infectious threats. It also shows the need to protect patient confidentiality and address stigma, which are important for maintaining community trust and cooperation. The report provides valuable guidance for strengthening outbreak preparedness and response in Sierra Leone and other areas confronting mpox and similar infections."

    "research_summary": "The deployment of renewable energy necessitates reliable grid-scale storage technologies. Aqueous metal battery systems are one of the promising candidates due to high safety, low cost, and high theoretical capacity of metal anodes, yet their long-term stability is hindered by dendritic growth and parasitic water-induced side reactions. In particular, in the case of aqueous zinc (Zn) batteries, high water reactivity at the metal anode results in hydrogen evolution and corrosion in conventional ZnSO 4 aqueous electrolytes. However, restrained water activity often leads to slow charge transport kinetics of solvated cations, limiting the high-rate operation capability of aqueous batteries. Here, we report a gradient composite hydrogel interlayer incorporating vermiculite (VMT) nanosheets within a polyacrylamide polymer matrix to synergistically regulate interfacial water dynamics and stabilize Zn anodes. Abundant hydroxyl groups and negatively charged silicate layers in VMT nanosheets strongly interact with adjacent water molecules, converting free water into bound water to suppress its activity. Charge transport behaviors of Zn ions in the hydrogel interlayer are further improved by rationally tuning the water activity along the depth of the interlayer, resulting in high ion diffusion kinetics close to the bulk electrolyte. Therefore, such a design enables Zn||Zn symmetric cells to stably cycle for over 2,000 h at 5 mA cm \u22122 and 5 mAh cm \u22122 , and sustain high current densities up to 40 mA cm \u22122 . This work brings critical scientific understanding on interfacial water dynamics and highlights its importance for durable metal anode during operation, advancing aqueous batteries toward practical grid-scale energy storage. Rechargeable batteries using electrodes based on intercalation chemistry exhibit notable cyclability, yet their performance still suffers from chemomechanical degradation. In this study, by combining a suite of operando microscopy methods, we explored electrode strain evolution and observed intricate particle cluster rearrangement under electrochemical stimuli. We show that early-stage strain accumulation in intercalation cathodes occurs during the period of interparticle charge transfer and redox reactions stemming from asynchronous coupling and decoupling between chemical (de)intercalation and physical grain motion. This interplay drives heterogeneous redox activity, localized charge equilibration, and multiscale strain cascades that propagate through an asynchronous network of chemical-mechanical interactions. Together, these findings reveal how collective particle dynamics and hierarchical strain transmission dictate electrode deformation and degradation in intercalation cathodes. Magnesium metal batteries are considered promising candidates for next-generation energy storage systems due to the high volumetric capacity, intrinsic safety and natural abundance of magnesium. Yet, the fundamental mechanisms that govern the magnesium deposition and the formation of surface interphases remain poorly understood, largely due to the complexity of battery chemistry and the lack of reliable techniques to probe these processes at the atomic scale. Here we show that, by using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, different magnesium deposition morphologies (e.g., whisker-shaped or seaweed-shaped) in conventional single-salt electrolytes converge to an intrinsic hexagonal platelet shape once surface passivation is decoupled from magnesium plating. This characteristic shape persists across different electrolyte chemistries, suggesting that suppressing surface passivation eliminates the influence of electrolyte composition on magnesium deposition morphology. These findings reveal the intrinsic nature of magnesium electrodeposition and establish a mechanistic link between interfacial chemistry and morphological evolution. Our work highlights a fundamental principle for controlling magnesium deposition behavior, paving the way for the rational design of stable, high-performance magnesium-based batteries. This review provides cascade electrocatalysis for carbon and nitrogen utilization, highlighting the multiscale relay strategies, in situ characterization and future opportunities in sustainable electrocatalytic conversion."

    "research_summary": "Drift diffusion models (DDMs) have found widespread use in computational neuroscience and other fields. They model evidence accumulation in simple decision tasks as a stochastic process drifting towards a decision barrier. In models where the drift rate is both time-varying within a trial and variable across trials, the high computational cost for accurate likelihood evaluation has led to the common use of a computationally convenient surrogate for parameter inference, the time-averaged drift approximation (TADA). In each trial, the TADA assumes that the time-varying drift rate can be replaced by its temporal average throughout the trial. This approach enables fast parameter inference using analytical likelihood formulas for DDMs with constant drift. In this work, we show that such an estimator is inconsistent: it does not converge to the true drift, posing a risk of biasing scientific conclusions drawn from parameter estimates produced by TADA and similar surrogates. We provide an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a Brownian motion with piecewise constant drift hitting a one-sided upper boundary. Furthermore, we conduct numerical examples with an attentional DDM (aDDM) to show that the use of TADA systematically misestimates the effect of attention in decision making. Abstract Early life adversity (ELA) confers risk for reward-related psychopathologies. These risks may stem from adaptations optimizing reward pursuit in anticipation of unreliable, resource poor environments. One rational adaptation to poor, unreliable environments is Behavioral Opportunism: updating expectations more slowly and acting vigorously only when reward is immediately available. To systematically test the impact of ELA on behavioral strategies and underlying reward processing mechanisms, we exposed mice to resource restriction (limited bedding and nesting materials for 7 days) to manipulate the reliability and quality of early life care. Subsequently, we tested adults\u2019 reward learning and decision making in a two-arm bandit task and recorded dopamine signaling using dLight1.2 fiber photometry in the nucleus accumbens core. Exposure to ELA led to poorer choice discrimination, impaired learning, and decreased adaptation to changes in reward availability. Furthermore, ELA mice were slower to choose between levers but were faster to retrieve immediately available rewards when delivered, consistent with a strategy of behavioral opportunism. Dopamine signaling predicted behavior in both rearing conditions, and its fluctuations were strongly predictive of faster retrieval in ELA mice and an increased likelihood of choice repetition, implying that aberrant dopamine signals underlie slowed learning and vigorous action for immediately available rewards. To understand key features of maternal interactions driving these effects, we used home cage video monitoring to quantify maternal behaviors, continuously, across early life. We found that specific experiential outcomes, such as maternal kicking, intensified behavioral opportunism in adults, predicting poorer bandit task performance beyond the group effect of ELA. Behavioral opportunism provides an explanatory framework for interpreting altered reward processing and reward pursuit in adulthood for individuals exposed to ELA. Behavioral learning impairments that seem similar across clinical groups can be linked to distinct neurocognitive mechanisms via integrative neurocomputational modeling. Our approach provides insights into the interplay of underlying learning mechanisms and how they manifest differently across psychopathologies. Abstract Background Major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BP), and schizophrenia (SCZ) involve learning impairments with poorly understood mechanisms. Understanding both the similarities and differences in these mechanisms is important to guide the development of new, targeted interventions. Methods 255 participants diagnosed with MDD (n=54), BP (n=47), SCZ (n=67) or without any diagnoses (CTRL; n=87) performed an associative learning task. Computational modeling quantified the mechanistic interplay between working memory (WM) and reinforcement learning (RL). The latent RL and WM signatures in the EEG dynamics showed shared and distinct neurocognitive mechanisms underlying learning. Results All clinical groups showed learning impairments at the behavioral level. Model-based EEG analyses linked these impairments to distinct patterns in the dynamic interplay between latent RL and WM mechanisms, contrasting with the typical patterns observed in CTRL. SCZ was characterized by reduced neural markers of WM, weakening the cooperative influence of WM onto RL (reduced WM recruitment), and reduced integration of negative feedback. Conversely, MDD was characterized by reduced reciprocal influence of RL onto WM, reducing the tendency to upregulate WM contribution with reward history (impaired WM management). "

    "research_summary": "The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far-reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single-band, extended <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <a:mi>t</a:mi> </a:math> - <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <c:mi>J</c:mi> </c:math> model where the background spins form a <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"> <e:msub> <e:mrow> <e:mi mathvariant=\"double-struck\">Z</e:mi> </e:mrow> <e:mn>2</e:mn> </e:msub> </e:math> quantum spin liquid. Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge-carrying holons and spin-carrying spinons as generally expected for a quantum spin liquid, the spinon-holon scattering cross section diverges for certain momenta, signaling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergences are due to the formation of long-lived spinon-holon bound states. Since the wave function of these bound states is localized over a few lattice sites, they correspond to well-defined fermions with the same charge and spin as the underlying electrons. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emerging fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a nonzero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the quantum spin liquid and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single-band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high-temperature superconductivity as arising from a quantum spin liquid. Moir\u00e9 materials provide exciting platforms for studying the interplay of strong electronic correlation and large magnetic flux effects. We study the lightly doped Hofstadter-Hubbard model on a triangular lattice through large-scale density matrix renormalization group and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find strong evidence for a robust chiral superconducting (SC) phase with dominant power-law pairing correlations and a quantized spin Chern number. The SC phase emerges at very weak interaction and grows stronger at intermediate interaction strengths (U ) for a wide range of hole doping. We also discuss the possible distinct nature of the normal state in different U regimes. Our work provides theoretical insights into the emergence of topological superconductivity from doping topological Chern bands or magnetic flux induced chiral spin liquid states of Moir\u00e9 materials. A variety of generative neural networks recently adopted from machine learning have provided promising strategies for studying quantum matter. In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ans\u00e4tze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ans\u00e4tz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables. We design a lattice model of a non-compact U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions with a flavor chemical potential and solve it with large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations. For zero flavor chemical potential, the model realizes three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (QED3) which has been argued to describe the ground state and low-energy excitations of the Dirac spin liquid phase of quantum antiferromagnets.

    "research_summary": "2,2',7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di(4-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9'-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) remains as the most widely used material for the hole transport layer (HTL) in efficient n-i-p perovskite photovoltaic devices. However, the conventional recipe, i.e., spiro-OMeTAD doped with bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) leads to poor device operational stability. Here, we introduce a strategy that employs light to generate protons in the precursor solution by ammonium TFSI dopants, which in turn increases the conductivity of HTL by the formation of oxidized spiro (referred to as light-oxidation doping treatment or LODT in short). Devices utilizing the LODT strategy results in reduced hysteresis and enhanced operational stability. The best perovskite solar module (PSM) achieves a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.95% for a 12.83 cm\u00b2 aperture area, standing out as one of the best Li-free spiro-OMeTAD HTL based PSMs. Furthermore, the unencapsulated perovskite solar cell has an extended operational stability profile exceeding 700 hours with only 7% decrease in the initial PCE."

    "research_summary": "Improving sensitivity in short-wave infrared (SWIR) detection is crucial for low-signal applications, such as astronomy and hyperspectral imaging, which demand readout integrated circuits (ROICs) with minimal noise and high density. However, conventional differential pixels with correlated double sampling (CDS) are difficult to integrate due to spatial limitations. In order to tackle this issue, we propose a compact, pixel-level, single-ended charge-domain architecture. It integrates single-ended CDS within each pixel, guaranteeing compatibility with the integrate-while-read (IWR) mode while suppressing reset and 1/f noise. A capacitor reuse technique is also proposed to enable the integration capacitor to function as an auxiliary load, which optimizes the noise\u2013area trade-off. Fabricated in 180 nm CMOS, our 1296 \u00d7 256 ROIC attains a noise floor of 0.50 mV (achieving a reduction of approximately 70% compared to conventional architectures under identical conditions), consumes under 200 mW, and operates at frequencies exceeding 200 Hz. It also exhibits great linearity (0.9999) and supports both integrate-then-read (ITR) mode and integrate-while-read (IWR) mode, while also providing a row-level gain selecting function. Validated at 15 \u03bcm pitch, this design provides an effective option for high-density SWIR systems. We use inelastic neutron scattering to study the impact of Li doping on the semiconducting altermagnet $\u03b1$-MnTe. Introducing Li results in a spin reorientation from in-plane to out-of-plane and increases the density of itinerant carriers. While the spin waves in Li-doped $\u03b1$-MnTe remain largely Heisenberg-like, there is significant spin wave broadening across the entire Brillouin zone, signaling enhanced magnon damping induced by itinerant carriers. By extracting the local dynamic susceptibility and applying the total moment sum rule, we find that both undoped and Li-doped $\u03b1$-MnTe exhibit the full expected Mn$^{2+}$ local moment of $\\approx5.9~\u03bc_\\mathrm{B}$ with $S=5/2$. These results demonstrate that Li-doped $\u03b1$-MnTe hosts robust local-moment magnetism whose interactions are mediated via Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida-type interactions, highlighting the importance of itinerant carriers in magneto-transport and spin dynamic properties of altermagnets. Primary Merkel carcinoma of the parotid gland is extremely rare. This case provides detailed clinical, histopathological, and therapeutic insights that may aid in improving early diagnosis and guiding effective surgical management. It also underscores the importance of vigilant postoperative follow-up to monitor for recurrence. ABSTRACT Objective Oral submucous fibrosis is a chronic oral disease with malignant potential. This study assessed survival outcomes and cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma arising from oral submucous fibrosis in central China. Methods 84 patients with carcinoma arising from oral submucous fibrosis treated between 2005 and 2019 were retrospectively reviewed and compared with 84 stage\u2010matched patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma unrelated to oral submucous fibrosis. Clinical features, recurrence, second primary tumors, lymph node metastasis, and survival were analyzed using chi\u2010square tests, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves, Cox regression, and the Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test. Results Patients with carcinoma arising from oral submucous fibrosis were more often male and had tumors predominantly located in the buccal mucosa. Compared with controls, these patients had significantly lower rates of cervical lymph node metastasis ( p &lt; 0.001) but higher rates of local recurrence ( p = 0.012) and second primary tumors ( p &lt; 0.001). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis demonstrated superior overall survival in the oral submucous fibrosis group ( p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression identified cervical lymph node metastasis ( p = 0.042), histological grade ( p = 0.038), local recurrence ( p &lt; 0.001), and second primary tumors ( p = 0.012) as independent prognostic factors. The Cochran\u2013Mantel\u2013Haenszel test confirmed a tendency toward earlier nodal metastasis in oral submucous fibrosis\u2010related cases ( p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions Carcinoma arising from oral submucous fibrosis demonstrates better survival outcomes and higher tumor differentiation but carries an increased risk of recurrence and second primary tumors. Enhanced clinical surveillance is recommended to improve early detection and patient prognosis."

    "research_summary": "With the acceleration of global climate change and urbanization, urban flooding disasters have become increasingly frequent, posing significant threats to urban safety and sustainable development. Enhancing Urban Flood Resilience (UFR) has become a central issue in urban risk management and spatial planning. This study aims to scientifically assess UFR by employing the core concepts of resistance, recovery, and adaptation from urban resilience theory. A set of 20 indicators for assessing UFR is selected from four aspects: infrastructure, social economy, technological monitoring, and the ecological environment. Addressing the limitations of traditional evaluation methods, which struggle to effectively handle data gaps and ambiguous boundaries, and fail to balance subjective and objective weights, this study introduces the unascertained measure theory and adopts a combined weighting method to construct a UFR evaluation model. Using 2023 statistical data from Jiangxi Province, a comprehensive evaluation of flood resilience was conducted across 11 prefecture-level cities within the province. The analysis indicates that, among level-2 indicators, infrastructure holds the highest weight at 43.7%. Regarding resilience dimensions, resistance dominates with a weight of 54.6%. Furthermore, significant spatial disparities exist in flood resilience levels across Jiangxi Province: high resilience cities are distributed in central and northern Jiangxi, moderately high resilience cities account for the largest proportion. Only one city, Pingxiang, exhibits moderate resilience. This article aims to systematically explore the ethical issues, technical principles, and governance strategies of artificial intelligence (AI). Artificial intelligence technology is developing at an unprecedented pace, having a profound impact on various fields of society. At the same time, its potential ethical risks, such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, and unclear responsibilities, are becoming increasingly prominent. To address these challenges, this article first reviews the development history, classification, and basic working principles of artificial intelligence, laying the foundation for understanding its ethical dilemmas. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis was conducted on the core definition of artificial intelligence ethics and the root causes of violations, with a focus on exploring the unique risks faced by different types of artificial intelligence technologies. Finally, from the macro level of society, individuals, and countries, as well as the micro level of technological governance, collaborative prevention and response strategies are proposed, such as developing transnational ethical standards, enhancing public awareness, building a sound legal system, and developing interpretable artificial intelligence, fairness, and privacy protection technologies. This article emphasizes that in order to align artificial intelligence with human values, it is necessary to work together at the legal, social, and technological levels to ensure that everyone has a safe, fair, and beneficial future. ABSTRACT The vertical two\u2010stage centrifugal pump (VTSP) is well\u2010suited for small pumped storage power stations with high head and low discharge, such as those found in underground mines. Based on entropy theory, this study presents a comparative numerical analysis of the flow energy dissipation (FED) in a VTSP under two distinct operating conditions: pump condition and turbine condition, both characterized by relatively high hydraulic efficiencies of 88.9% and 87.4%, respectively. The numerical solutions were obtained using the steady\u2010state single\u2010phase SST k\u2010\u03c9 turbulence model. The results indicate that the region within 2 mm of the wall contributes the majority of the FED production in both pump and turbine conditions. This portion of the FED is influenced by the viscosity\u2010dominated flow\u2010wall interaction. In pump condition, the highest FED production occurs in the return channel, with the backward vane and forward vane regions contributing 38.3% and 14.4%, respectively. In turbine condition, the highest FED production occurs in the runners, with the first and second\u2010stage runners contributing 43.7% and 21.4%, respectively. To enhance efficiency in both modes, reducing the surface roughness of the flow channels is recommended. Additionally, optimizing the alignment between the guide vanes within the return channel and the fluid, as well as improving the matching between the runner blades and the fluid, can further improve efficiency in pump and turbine conditions, respectively. High-quality information set abstraction remains a core challenge in solving large-scale imperfect-information extensive-form games (IIEFGs)--such as no-limit Texas Hold'em--where the finite nature of spatial resources hinders solving strategies for the full game. State-of-the-art AI methods rely on pre-trained discrete clustering for abstraction, yet their hard class"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Thermoelectric technology uses the Seebeck effect to directly convert heat into electricity or vice versa. Amongst its advantages are the lack of moving parts, reliability, absence of refrigerant gasses and scalability. To date, commercial progress has been limited due to relatively low conversion efficiencies and high costs. However, with increasing energy costs, the advent of the Internet of Things and its needs to power many sensors, and the need for thermal management in electronics, there is plenty of reason to be optimistic about the future of thermoelectric energy conversion. Beyond using abundant elements, sustainability has so far not been a major consideration in the development of thermoelectric technology, with its understandable emphasis on improving performance. However, sustainability aspects, including eco-friendly processing, resource efficient module fabrication, ensuring a long working life and end of life recycling should all be major considerations from the outset. This roadmap aims to provide an overview of current efforts moving towards sustainable thermoelectrics as well as guidance for future work. In terms of organisation, the roadmap contains cross-cutting sections on aspects of sustainability and sections focused on the major thermoelectric materials. It can be read front to back or focusing on chapters of particular interest. We hope that this roadmap will stimulate new research, leading to the early adoption of sustainability concepts, beyond using abundant elements, in the development of large-scale thermoelectric technology. The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning is rapidly transforming the landscape of materials discovery, facilitating unprecedented acceleration in the exploration of vast chemical spaces and the prediction of material properties. However, the adoption of these advanced techniques has not been uniform across all subfields of materials science; thermoelectrics, for instance, has experienced a relatively slower penetration. This lag can be attributed to several inherent challenges, including the physical complexity of thermoelectric phenomena, the scarcity and reliability issues of available data, and limitations concerning the applicability of general models. To address these challenges, in this work, we have developed a machine learning model, based on neural networks, specifically for the accurate prediction of the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) in skutterudites. This model demonstrates high accuracy, with prediction errors approaching the range of experimental uncertainties reported for zT measurements. Furthermore, it offers the crucial capability of extracting design rules grounded in the underlying physics and chemistry of these materials, providing valuable insights for optimization. Most importantly, our model is applicable for the high-throughput screening of extensive chemical spaces, facilitating the efficient discovery of novel and high-performance thermoelectric materials."

    "research_summary": "Rechargeable batteries using electrodes based on intercalation chemistry exhibit notable cyclability, yet their performance still suffers from chemomechanical degradation. In this study, by combining a suite of operando microscopy methods, we explored electrode strain evolution and observed intricate particle cluster rearrangement under electrochemical stimuli. We show that early-stage strain accumulation in intercalation cathodes occurs during the period of interparticle charge transfer and redox reactions stemming from asynchronous coupling and decoupling between chemical (de)intercalation and physical grain motion. This interplay drives heterogeneous redox activity, localized charge equilibration, and multiscale strain cascades that propagate through an asynchronous network of chemical-mechanical interactions. Together, these findings reveal how collective particle dynamics and hierarchical strain transmission dictate electrode deformation and degradation in intercalation cathodes. We present a mathematical model to delineate the complex electrochemical processes in aqueous batteries during the charge and discharge cycles. The model represents an aqueous battery cell by a one-dimensional continuum containing two interacting domains: a liquid electrolyte and a solid matrix. It accounts for ion and charge transport, chemical and electrochemical reactions (e.g., adsorption, nucleation, deposition, and dissolution) in the two domains or at their interfaces, and reaction-induced solid-phase morphological evolution. We validate the model by a comprehensive set of experimentally-measured charge--discharge curves for a wide range of aqueous batteries and cycling conditions. Our modeling framework provides a mechanistic tool for examining the underlying physical and electrochemical processes in aqueous battery cells, and designing high-utilization low-cost aqueous batteries for grid-scale energy storage. Solid-state chemical diffusion in active materials is one of the most typically invoked mechanisms for understanding the rate capability and capacity utilization of battery electrodes and cells. In this context, chemical diffusion can be viewed as a process where the capacitance of material near the electrochemical reaction site is accessed rapidly, whereas capacitance further from the site is accessed more slowly. It is this rate distribution of chemical capacitance that creates the electrochemical signatures we recognize as diffusion: polarization scaling with time 1/2 or impedance scaling with frequency -1/2 . Conversely, whenever such signals are electrochemically measured, they are typically attributed to chemical diffusion processes. Here, we present experimental evidence showing that the kinetics of typical battery agglomerate particles does not follow this conventional model. Furthermore, we demonstrate using a porous agglomerate particle model that diffusion-like signatures can appear without any diffusion processes whatsoever. Organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) are an emerging class of materials with the potential to enable next-generation bioelectronic and energy technologies. Beyond their impressive capacitance, transconductance, and rate capabilities, OMIECs offer flexibility, easy processability, and the advantages of being composed of earth-abundant elements. Despite rapid progress in their development, a critical question persists: how do OMIECs interact with water, and how do their interactions with water impact their function? In this perspective, we explore the critical and complex role of water in determining OMIEC structure, charge transport properties, and electrochemical performance. We discuss how water's presence influences swelling, ion solvation, dielectric properties, and redox behavior, often in ways that depart from traditional redox-active polymer design rules. We provide an overview of emerging experimental and computational tools for deconvoluting these interactions. Finally, we argue for a shift toward well-defined model systems with controlled chemistries to probe hydration effects systematically. Bridging these foundational knowledge gaps will enable continued rapid progress in developing OMIECs for real-world applications."

    "research_summary": "With the increasing intelligence of electronic information systems, urgent demand exists for high-performance customized electromagnetic shielding materials. However, traditional research and development paradigms are constrained by critical bottlenecks, like multi-parameter coupling, high trial-and-error costs, and multi-scale design hurdles, failing to satisfy efficient material development needs. Artificial intelligence (AI), leveraging its core advantages of data-driven approaches and algorithmic optimization, offers a transformative paradigm to overcome these bottlenecks. Although AI-driven methodologies have demonstrated tremendous potential in the design of electromagnetic shielding materials, systematic barriers from inadequate interdisciplinary collaboration still limit its technological empowerment. In response to these challenges, we highlight the following solutions to advance AI-enabled electromagnetic shielding material design: (1) developing neural network models driven by data-physics integration, (2) developing domain-specific large language models for electromagnetic shielding materials, (3) establishing comprehensive databases for electromagnetic shielding materials, and (4) promoting domain-specific data sharing and the construction of standardized protocols. Small-angle measurement technology plays an important role in aerospace, lithography machine chip manufacturing, precision mechanical manufacturing, etc. However, despite decades of development, existing methods still rely on laser interferometers, and the resolution remains at 0.001 arcseconds. As science and technology progress rapidly, high-precision technologies like lithography machines urgently need higher angular resolution. Since frequency is the most precisely measurable physical quantity, converting angle measurement into frequency measurement is expected to achieve order-of-magnitude breakthroughs in the resolution limitation. In this paper, we propose a quantum frequency goniometer (QFG) based on common mode noise-canceling laser frequency measurement designed to achieve ultra-high precision in angle measurement. The QFG integrates a frequency selection element interference filter (IF) with a transparent solid or liquid medium, exploiting the high sensitivity of laser frequency to variations in cavity length and the incident angle of the IF. A beat frequency measurement equipment is used to detect the differential output frequency before and after angle variations, allowing for precise determination of the frequency shift induced by angle changes. By extracting the frequency difference from the beat frequency signal, the system effectively eliminates the common mode frequency noise introduced during free-running operation. Theoretical analysis indicates that the QFG has the potential to enhance angular measurement resolution, achieving a resolution better than 10 \u22125 arcseconds (10 \u22129 deg)."

    "research_summary": "Project Goal and Objective. The demand for energy and for an upgraded energy infrastructure has steadily grown, as have the needs for energy independence and alternatives to our reliance on petroleum. Hydrogen is considered the most viable fuels for wide-scale implementation in the near future as it is less-polluting, non-toxic, and has more stored energy than petroleum. It is envisioned that hydrogen can eventually become the prime energy carrier, integrating the transportation, grid, and chemical sectors in a way that improves resiliency, diversifies feedstocks, and affords new economic opportunities. A key remaining challenge is the development materials with enhanced gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen storage capacities that offer a higher performance than compressed gas. These materials would eliminate the need for large-scale compression, thereby dramatically reducing the footprint and cost of gas storage. The high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacities of complex hydrides has prompted an intensive investigation of the potential of this class of materials as hydrogen storage media over the past 25 years.[1] Among the many complex hydrides that have been explored, magnesium borohydride, Mg(BH4)2, has been found to possess the best combination of practical thermodynamic properties. These include a gravimetric H2 density of 14.9 wt% H2 and thermodynamics for the dehydrogenation of Mg(BH4)2 to MgB2 (equation 1) (\u0394Ho = 39 kJ/mol H2, \u0394S = 112 J/K mol H2) which lie in the narrow window required Mg(BH4)2 \uf0db MgB2 + 4 H2 (1) for reversibility under moderate pressure and temperature.[2] However, overcoming the extremely slow kinetics of the reversible release of hydrogen by this material in the solid state is a daunting challenge. At temperatures greater than 400 \u00b0C, the borohydride releases up to 14 wt% hydrogen giving MgB2.[3-7] We discovered that the direct re-hydrogenation of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)2 can be accomplished under 950 bar H2 at 400 \u00b0C.[8] While this demonstrated that complete reversibility can be achieved, the conditions employed are far too extreme for commercial hydrogen storage applications. More recently, we found through US DOE funded research projects (EERE HyMARC and HySCOR), that hydrogen cycling, can be accomplish at much milder conditions upon modification of the borohydride or boride.[8-10] Guided by these discoveries these discoveries, the objective of this research project was to obtain key information that will enable the development of a model of reversible hydrogenation of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)2. The ultimate goal of our efforts is to attain a model of this transformation that can be utilized to accelerate development further advanced materials. This project directly follows on discoveries that were made over the course of a US DOE, EERE HyMARC project that was focused on improvement of the hydrogen cycling kinetics of modified MgB2. We found that that mechanical milling with graphene results the desired, pronounced kinetic enhancement.[11] The dramatic lowering of the conditions required for the hydrogenation of MgB2 is a significant step towards overcoming its chemical inertness allowing its development as a practical onboard hydrogen storage material. However, the exact nature of the modification(s) of MgB2 that is responsible for its activation towards hydrogenation is completely unknown. This situation is not unique, as efforts to develop hydrogen storage materials typically have a narrow focus rather than a comprehensive approach that takes atomic level bonding and structure; molecular dynamics; long range, nano- and mesoscale-structure and their interconnection all into account. The goal of this project was the development of a comprehensive, multi-scale computational model of reversible hydrogenation of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)2 that can be utilized for development of higher performance versions of the modified material. Development of the model requires determination of: 1) the bulk, nano-scale, and meso-scale structural changes occurring at elevated pressure following mechano-chemical modification of MgB2; 2) the reaction pathway of the reversible hydrogenation of MgB2 to Mg(BH4)2; 3) the effect of elevated pressure and mechano-chemical modification on the chemical reaction pathways; 4) the interactions at solid-gas interfaces; and particle surfaces; and 5) the kinetics and thermodynamic parameters associated with each step of the hydrogenation reaction pathway. This investigation required advanced techniques as preliminary, standard XRD, 11B NMR, and FTIR analysis showed no signs of material modification. In order to gain this level of understanding of modified MgB2, required the teaming of a diverse group of experts and state-of-the art experimental capabilities at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) and collaborating National Laboratories: Craig Jensen, Department of Chemistry (PI and Project Director), solid state, solution, and high pressure NMR spectroscopy; solid-state synth"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Multi\u2010target biosensing platforms require immobilization of sensing probes on surfaces with nanoscale precision. A critical challenge is preventing unwanted molecular transfer (cross\u2010pollination) between different probe patterns, which compromises measurement accuracy. This study investigates cross\u2010pollination in multiplexed biosensing arrays fabricated using thermal scanning probe lithography (tSPL), a method that offers sub\u201010 nm spatial resolution. By systematically optimizing both the tSPL patterning parameters and chemical functionalization protocols, particularly biomolecule incubation times, this work demonstrates the ability to reduce cross\u2010pollination to undetectable levels (0%). These experimental results establish a clear relationship between processing conditions and cross\u2010contamination rates, providing a practical framework for reliable nanoscale patterning of multiple biomolecular probes on a single surface. These findings enable the development of high\u2010fidelity, multi\u2010target biosensing platforms with enhanced specificity, and therefore sensitivity, for applications in medical diagnostics, environmental monitoring, and biological research. To overcome the challenge of scalable IR-transparent top contacts, we introduce a Ag NW\u2013PVA film with &gt;70% IR transmittance and \u223c11 \u03a9 sq \u22121 resistance. Integrated with quantum dots, it enables high-detectivity (\u223c2.9 \u00d7 10 11 Jones) IR photodiodes. Emergent electronic phenomena, from superconductivity to ferroelectricity, magnetism, and correlated many-body band gaps, have been observed in domains created by stacking and twisting atomic layers of Van der Waals materials. In graphene, emergent properties have been observed in ABC stacking domains obtained by exfoliation followed by expert mechanical twisting and alignment with the desired orientation, a process very challenging and nonscalable. Here, conductive atomic force microscopy shows in untwisted epitaxial graphene grown on SiC the surprising presence of striped domains with dissimilar conductance, a contrast that demonstrates the presence of ABA and ABC domains since it matches exactly the conductivity difference observed in ABA/ABC domains in twisted exfoliated graphene and calculated by density functional theory. The size and geometry of the stacking domains depend on the interplay between strain, solitons crossing, and shape of the three-layer regions. Interestingly, we demonstrate the growth of three-layer regions in which the ABA/ABC stacking domains self-organize in stable stripes of a few tens of nanometers. The growth-controlled production of isolated and stripe-shaped ABA/ABC domains open the path to fabricate quantum devices on these domains. These findings on self-assembly formation of ABA/ABC epitaxial graphene stripes on SiC without the need of time-consuming and nonscalable graphene exfoliation, alignment, and twisting provide different potential applications of graphene in electronic devices. The need for higher sensitivity and parallel detection of multiple biological targets drives the research on electronic biosensing platforms based on two-dimensional (2D) materials. However, signal fidelity from individual sensors may be compromised due to the existing nonidealities of 2D electronic devices. Here, we use graphene field effect transistors (gFETs) as a model system to investigate a multisensor device architecture. We identify two potential sources of crosstalk interference between sensors in such a platform: resistive interference through shared gFET channels and capacitive coupling through the shared device substrate. Having illustrated these sources of interference, we offer solutions to mitigate them for ensuring the fidelity of the biosensor signal. This study provides important practical insights for researchers working on 2D biosensor platforms. Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) infrared (IR) photodetectors can be fabricated and operated with larger spectral tunability, fewer limitations in terms of cooling requirements and substrate lattice matching, and at a potentially lower cost than detectors based on traditional bulk materials. Silver selenide (Ag<sub>2</sub>Se) has emerged as a promising sustainable alternative to current state-of-the-art toxic semiconductors based on lead, cadmium, and mercury operating in the IR. However, an impeding gap in available absorption bandwidth for Ag<sub>2</sub>Se CQDs exists in the short-wave infrared (SWIR) region due to degenerate doping by the environment, switching the CQDs from intrinsic interband semiconductors in the near-infrared (NIR) to intraband absorbing CQDs in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Herein, we show that the small molecular p-type dopant 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane (F4-TCNQ) can be used to extract electrons from the 1S<sub>e</sub> state of MWIR active Ag<sub>2</sub>Se CQDs to activate their intrinsic energy gap in the SWIR window. We demonstrate quenching of the MWIR Ag<sub>2</sub>Se absorban"

The IM of the different cell wall layers were close between early- and latewoods indicating small differences between their chemical compositions. AFM IR indicate a gradient of lignin and cellulose across the cell wall with an increase of lignin and a decrease of cellulose from the S2 to the S1 and finally to the CC. Earlywood and latewood cell walls display the same hygro\u2013nanomechanical behavior during S/D cycle, i.e., the IM decrease with during sorption up to 85% and re\u2013increase during desorption. Gaussian fits of the IM distribution were narrower for late wood than early wood and vary with the type of layer and with the relative humidity. The responses of the indentation moduli to RH of the cell wall layers in early- and latewood were fitted according to a three-parameter logistic function. Significant differences are observed for the S2 in both EW and LW indicating a higher slope in the response of indentation moduli to RH between 15 and 50% RH in desorption as compared to sorption. For both desorption and sorption, the comparison between EW <italic>vs</italic> LW reveals differences in CC and S1, with a higher slope in moduli response to RH in LW between 15 and 50% RH and the opposite between 50 to 85% RH."

    "research_summary": "Introduction: A global gap exists in access to standard care for ischemic stroke, including thrombolysis. Most thrombolysis-capable centers in India are located in major cities, making it difficult for many patients to reach them within the golden hour. Telemedicine can help facilitate thrombolysis in remote areas. This study aimed to evaluate the outcomes of patients who received thrombolysis under the Swasthya Ingit Telestroke Program in West Bengal, India, and to describe the challenges faced during the program. Methods: This multicentric observational study analyzes secondary data collected from the Swasthya Ingit Telestroke Program. It compares the outcomes of patients who received thrombolysis in 32 hospitals that used teleconsultation (telemedicine group) with those treated in 9 hospitals where patients were thrombolyzed under the direct supervision of a neurologist (direct supervision group). Outcome comparisons included functional independence (modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0\u20132 at 90 days), all-cause mortality within 90 days, and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH). Results: Since the start of the telestroke program in December 2021, 1,329 patients have received thrombolysis (1,034 in the \u201ctelemedicine group\u201d and 295 in the \u201cdirect supervision group\u201d) through June 2024. After excluding patients without 90-day follow-up data, 1,145 patients were included in the analysis. The two groups showed no significant difference in good functional outcomes (mRS 0\u20132 at 90 days), mortality, and sICH (p values of 0.833, 0.73, and 0.61, respectively). Conclusion: Telemedicine in stroke care has enabled thrombolysis in remote and resource-limited areas. Our study further emphasizes the effectiveness of telemedicine in increasing access to stroke reperfusion therapy in a lower-middle-income country. However, limited awareness prevents many ischemic stroke patients from receiving timely treatments like thrombolysis due to delayed arrival at equipped centers. Stroke awareness campaigns are crucial for the optimal utilization of a telestroke network. Increasing concentrations of oxygen in the early atmosphere contributed to the development of the Earth's ozone shield and thus ushered in the growth of photoautotrophs. The proliferation of multicellular life is linked with the rise of atmospheric oxygen, known as the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). However, it has become evident that the permanent trend of rising oxygen in the atmosphere was preceded by multiple fluctuations. It is imperative to gather information from immediate pre- and post-GOE successions for constraining this transformation. The greenstone successions from > 3.8 Ga to the Archean-Proterozoic transition are important candidates for deciphering the evolution of the atmosphere and hydrosphere. The Archean Singhbhum craton, eastern India, hosts a well-preserved low-grade greenstone succession, the Western Iron Ore Group (W-IOG), containing banded iron formations (BIF) from pre-GOE stratigraphy. We report here zircon U-Pb LA-ICPMS age of ~ 2500 Ma from felsic tuff below the BIF and detrital zircon age of ~ 2730 Ma from underlying sandstones that constrain the age of the younger cycle of BIF deposition in the W-IOG as Neoarchean grading into the Paleoproterozoic. The newly reported Neoarchean to Paleoproterozoic age of the W-IOG provides potential opportunity for future research on the tempos and events immediately ahead of the GOE in the oceanic realm at the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. A field trial was conducted during Rabi seasons (2012-13 and 2013-14) in the acidic soils of Keonjhar district of Odisha to assess the effect of lime, boron, and farmyard manure (FYM) on yield and quality of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea L. var. botrytis). The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design with three replications and involved eighteen treatment combinations. These treatments consisted of two levels of FYM (0 and 5 t/ha), three levels of lime (0, 0.1 LR, and 0.2 LR), and three levels of boron (0, 0.5 kg/ha with 0.25% foliar spray and 1.0 kg/ha), with all plots receiving a uniform recommended dose of N, P2O5 and K2O (150:60:80 kg/ha). Results indicated that the combined application of FYM at 5 t/ha, lime at 0.2 LR and boron at 1.0 kg/ha produced the highest dry matter yield. This treatment increased curd yield by 29.8% and dry matter yield by 40% over the control. Additionally, significant improvements were observed in growth attributes with increases of 35% in plant height, 48.4% in the number of leaves, 10.3% in plant spread, 37.5% in stalk length, 13.9% in curd diameter, 43% in curd weight, and 9.4% in curd length. Quality parameters including ascorbic acid and protein content, were also enhanced through combined application of FYM, lime and boron. The best treatment registered a net return of Rs. 1,24,450/- with a benefit-cost ratio of 4.27, making it highly recommended for cauliflower cultivation in red and lateritic soils of Odisha."

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background Undergraduate STEM instructors want to help students learn and retain knowledge for their future courses and careers. One promising evidence-based technique that is thought to increase long-term memory is spaced retrieval practice, or repeated testing over time. The beneficial effect of spacing has repeatedly been demonstrated in the laboratory as well as in undergraduate mathematics courses, but its generalizability across diverse STEM courses is unknown. We investigated the effect of spaced retrieval practice in nine introductory STEM courses. Retrieval practice opportunities were embedded in bi-weekly quizzes, either massed on a single quiz or spaced over multiple quizzes. Student performance on practice opportunities and a criterial test at the end of each course were examined as a function of massed or spaced practice. We also conducted a single-paper meta-analysis on criterial test scores to assess the generalizability of the effectiveness of spaced retrieval practice across introductory STEM courses. Results Significant positive effects of spacing on the criterial test were found in only two courses (Calculus I for Engineers and Chemistry for Health Professionals), although small positive effect sizes were observed in two other courses (General Chemistry and Diversity of Life). Meta-analyses revealed a significant spacing effect when all courses were included, but not when calculus was excluded. The generalizability of the spacing effect across STEM courses therefore remains unclear. Conclusions Although we could not clearly determine the generalizability of the benefits of spacing in STEM courses, our findings indicate that spaced retrieval practice could be a low-cost method of improving student performance in at least some STEM courses. More work is needed to determine when, how, and for whom spaced retrieval practice is most beneficial. The effect of spacing in classroom settings may depend on some design features such as the nature of retrieval practice activities (multiple-choice versus short answer) and/or feedback settings, as well as student actions (e.g., whether they look at feedback or study outside of practice opportunities). The evidence is promising, and further pragmatic research is encouraged. Purpose Characteristics of the metal powder are a key factor in the success of powder bed fusion (PBF) additive manufacturing. Powders for PBF from different manufacturers may have a different particle size and/or bulk packing and flow behavior. Powder properties change as the powder is reused for multiple builds. This study seeks to measure the variability of commercial 17-4 PH stainless steel powders to determine the effect of powder variability on part density and demonstrate characterization methods that ensure part quality. Design/methodology/approach Commercial atomized metal powders from four different vendors were produced with two different atomizing gases (N2 and argon). Powder was characterized in both new and extensively reused conditions. All powders were characterized for flow and packing behavior, particle size and internal porosity. Coupons were manufactured using the laser PBF process with optimized scan strategy and exposure parameters. The quality of fabricated parts was measured using bulk density measurement. Findings Despite differences in powder flowability and particle size, fully dense parts (&gt;99 per cent) were produced using all powders, except one. Residual porosity in these parts appeared to result from gas trapped in the powder particles. The powder with extensive reuse (400+ h in machine fabrication environment) exhibited reduced flowability and increased fraction of fine particles, but still produced full density parts. Originality/value This study demonstrates that full density parts can be fabricated using powders with a range of flowability and packing behavior. This suggests that a single flowability measurement may be sufficient for quality assurance in a production environment. Abstract This article covers in-line process monitoring of the metal additive manufacturing (AM) methods of laser and electron beam (e-beam) powder-bed fusion (PBF) and directed-energy deposition (DED). It focuses on methods that monitor the component directly throughout the build process. This article is organized by the type of AM process and by the physics of the monitoring method. The discussion covers two types of monitoring possible with the PBF process: monitoring the area of the powder bed and component and monitoring the melt pool created by the laser or e-beam. Methods for layer monitoring include optical and thermal methods that monitor light reflected or emitted in the visible and infrared wavelengths, respectively. Monitoring methods for laser directed-energy deposition (DED) discussed are those that measure the size and shape of the melt pool, the temperature of the melt pool, and the plasma generated by the laser as it interacts with the molten me"

    "research_summary": "How the United States can compete in the twenty-first century is one of the most vexing challenges for policy makers and academics today. Many studies have shown that most impactful science and technology advances happen in open and diverse environments, under excellent research conditions, with sufficient funding. Since the end of World War II, the United States has been the most attractive country for open research and commercialization of new discoveries. This strategy\u2014partly articulated in science administrator Vannevar Bush\u2019s Endless Frontier report of 1945\u2014leverages federal government investments in research and development (R&amp;D) to enhance economic competitiveness and national security. The combination of a dynamic, open research ecosystem and world-leading science infrastructure provided an exciting work environment leading to groundbreaking discoveries, and propelled economic growth through the second half of the twentieth century. This summer\u2019s release of Oppenheimer, the major Hollywood movie by Christopher Nolan, has brought renewed attention to J. Robert Oppenheimer\u2019s thoughts, concerns, and intentions regarding the U.S. pursuit of thermonuclear weapons. This paper provides context surrounding the 1949 recommendation of the Atomic Energy Commission\u2019s General Advisory Committee, chaired by Oppenheimer, against a crash program for hydrogen bombs, a recommendation that would be used against him in the 1954 decision to revoke his security clearance. An appendix reproduces the April 5, 2022, letter from Los Alamos National Laboratory directors to the secretary of energy. In December 2022, Secretary of Energy Granholm vacated the original security review board decision. Abstract BackgroundThere is increasing demand for more rapid evaluation of innovation in health and social care to support timely decision-making about service redesign. Making evaluations more rapid raises challenges of rigour and effective use of resources, but assessment of rapid evaluation methodologies has been lacking. Objectives: To map the developing field of methods of rapid evaluation of innovation in health and related social careDesign: Scoping reviewMethods: We searched multiple databases and websites of key organisations to identify rapid evaluations of innovations, methods of rapid evaluation or rapid evaluation of implementation in high income countries.We extracted information to enable us to classify and map existing studies on key characteristics. We undertook a narrative synthesis to identify the evidence and the gaps, focussing on the different approaches to conducting rapid evaluation in primary research. ResultsWe identified 14069 records from our searches, evaluated 352 in full text and included 72 studies. We identified four main approaches used for rapid evaluation: (1) Use of a methodology designed specifically for rapid evaluation;(2) Increasing rapidity by doing less or using a less time-intensive methodology;(3) Use of alternative technologies and/or data to increase the speed of an existing evaluation method; (4) Adaptation of part of a non-rapid evaluation We found little research comparing rapid and non-rapid evaluation.ConclusionsThis scoping review identified a lack of clarity about what \u2018rapid evaluation\u2019 means but identified useful preliminary categories. There is a need for clarity and consistency in terms of: what constitutes rapid evaluation; consistent terminology in reporting evaluations as rapid; the development of specific methodologies for making evaluation more rapid; and assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of rapid methodology in terms of rigour, cost and impact. During the Second World War, Canada made several important contributions to wartime nuclear research efforts. The three main contributions were: establishing a domestic nuclear research laboratory in Montreal to investigate heavy water reactor; creating supply chains to provide uranium oxide, heavy water, and polonium to the Manhattan Project; and the direct contributions of several Canadians living in the United States to the project. These wartime efforts helped establish a legacy of nuclear research in Canada that has persisted to the present day."

    "research_summary": "Aims: The global prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) among the elderly population aged 65 years and above is estimated to be 10%. While it is known to be associated with poor prognoses in patients with cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, the significance of PHT as an incidental finding among individuals without these conditions remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between incidental PHT detected by echocardiography and long-term all-cause mortality in patients without known cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases. Methods and Results: This retrospective, single-center cohort study included 8283 patients who underwent two consecutive echocardiographic examinations evaluating pulmonary pressure by assessing the maximal velocity of the tricuspid regurgitation jet. In total, 1705 (20.6%) patients were found to have PHT during the first echocardiography. Using a Cox proportional hazard model for all-cause mortality, PHT was found to be a significant and independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, increasing the risk by 34% (Adj. HR\u20141.34, 95% CI 1.21\u20131.47, p &lt; 0.001). There was a direct relationship between PHT severity and long-term all-cause mortality, with patients with severe PHT having a two-fold higher risk compared to those with normal pulmonary blood pressure (Adj. HR\u20142, 95% CI: 1.58\u20132.54, p &lt; 0.001). A \u201ccutoff point\u201d of sPAP &gt; 40 mmHg was established, where pulmonary pressure values remained high and even worsened over time (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: The incidental diagnosis of PHT by echocardiography in patients without known cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases is an independent risk factor for long-term all-cause mortality. Patients with sPAP \u2265 40 mmHg warrant a comprehensive clinical assessment. Abstract Background Immunoglobulin (Ig)E deficiency (&lt;2.5 IU/mL) in adults is linked to higher risks of cancer and autoimmunity, but its significance in children remains unclear. This study evaluates the clinical importance of IgE deficiency in a nationwide pediatric cohort. Methods A retrospective, population\u2010based study included 123,393 Israeli children tested for IgE levels between 2002 and 2022. Participants were categorized into four groups: deficient (&lt;2.5 IU/mL), normal (2.5\u2013100 IU/mL), high (100\u20131000 IU/mL), and very high (\u22651000 IU/mL). Outcomes included cancer, inborn errors of immunity (IEI), and autoimmune disorders, with up to 5 years of follow\u2010up. The data were analyzed using univariable methods and multivariable Cox regression. Results Among the cohort, 2114 children (1.71%) had IgE deficiency, with a mean age of 3.73 years. Most (95.60%) were tested only once. IgE deficiency was associated with increased risks of solid tumors (HR = 2.721; 95% CI: 1.313\u20135.638), IEI (HR = 1.646; 95% CI: 1.095\u20132.474), and autoimmune disorders (HR = 1.266; 95% CI: 1.099\u20131.458) compared to normal IgE levels. No link was found between IgE deficiency and hematological malignancies. Selective IgM deficiency was the most common IEI associated with IgE deficiency (40%). Asthma prevalence was highest in children with very high IgE ( N = 5574; 57.01%) and lowest in the normal IgE group ( N = 24,171; 38.91%). The IgE\u2010deficient group fell in the middle range ( N = 903; 42.72%). In IgE\u2010deficient children, allergic rhinitis was less common (11.26% vs. 14.09%). Conclusion IgE deficiency in children is associated with higher risks of solid tumors, autoimmune disorders, and IEI, suggesting potential immune dysregulation. Close monitoring of IgE\u2010deficient children should be considered."

    "research_summary": "Requirements to reduce the emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO/sub x/) from gas turbines used in aircraft propulsion and stationary power generation have led to consideration of several low-emission combustor concepts. As part of the engineering research, design and development of these combustors, multi-dimensional combustion computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations are increasingly being utilized. To examine the ability of combustion CFD to accurately predict emissions, a series of calculations have been performed with STAR-CD, a general purpose commercial CFD package capable of treating three-dimensional flows with turbulence, sprays and chemical reactions. Some of the calculations shown in this paper make use of a new coupled n-step chemistry solver combining features of CHEMKIN with STAR-CD which is being developed jointly by Reaction Design and adapco. The NO/sub x/ predictions are made via two techniques. In the first, a joint scalar PPDF thermal NO/sub x/ post-processor is employed in conjunction with a two-step combined timescale combustion model. In the second approach, a reduced 26-step finite rate kinetics mechanism is utilized. Here, the combustion chemistry is combined with the NO/sub x/ formation chemistry based on the extended Zel'dovich mechanism for thermal NO/sub x/ and a surrogate species approach for prompt NO/sub x/. Comparisons to experimental data show that both approaches can produce reasonable predictions. OPPDIF is a Fortran program that computes the diffusion flame between two opposing nozzles. A similarity transformation reduces the two-dimensional axisymmetric flow field to a one-dimensional problem. Assuming that the radial component of velocity is linear in radius, the dependent variables become functions of the axial direction only. OPPDIF solves for the temperature, species mass fractions, axial and radial velocity components, and radial pressure gradient, which is an eigenvalue in the problem. The TWOPNT software solves the two-point boundary value problem for the steady-state form of the discretized equations. The CHEMKIN package evaluates chemical reaction rates and thermodynamic and transport properties."

    "research_summary": "While the potential use of copolymerized electrolytes in Li metal batteries is subject to intense investigation, the fundamental understanding of the nanoscale domain formation and its effect on Li<sup>+</sup> transport is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the Li<sup>+</sup> transport mechanism and the miscibility of monomers in polymer blend electrolytes derived from the in situ copolymerization of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and vinylene carbonate (VC) in the presence of polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether (PEGDME) plasticizer and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) salt. The addition of a polar short chain plasticizer reduced the dynamic and structural heterogeneities of the electrolyte. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to investigate the nanoscale structure of the electrolytes. The distribution of relaxation times corresponding to the three distinct diffusion mechanisms of the free and interfacial Li<sup>+</sup> ions at the copolymer/plasticizer and electrolyte/SEI boundaries was analyzed in a broad temperature range to elucidate the Li<sup>+</sup> transport mechanism. The chemical composition of the SEI and the contribution of a ceramic lithium lanthanum zirconium oxide (LLZO, Li<sub>7</sub>La<sub>3</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>12</sub>) phase on the interfacial resistance, salt degradation, and SEI stability were studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profile analysis and electrochemical testing. Contact resistance between the cathode active material (CAM) and the Al current collector can be reduced by applying carbon coatings to the Al current collector surface. However, this process requires an additional step of carbon layer coating on the current collector, which increases both manufacturing costs and processing time. In the present work, an interlayer of continuous unsized carbon fibers aligned in one direction (CF interlayer), is introduced between the Al current collector and the NMC811 cathode during cathode deposition on the Al current collector. This single-step approach eliminates the need for the additional carbon layer coating on the current collector. Additionally, this approach removes the use of toxic solvents and insulative polymers used for making the carbon coating. The CF interlayer improves the rate capability at higher C-rates. The CF interlayer lowers the contact resistance between the cathode particles and the current collector while improving the activation energy of charge transfer. The peel test showed that the CF interlayer does not affect the adhesion strength of the cathode layer with the current collector. Energy storage technologies, particularly those utilizing phase change materials (PCMs), have gained attention for their high energy density and efficient thermal management. PCMs, which store energy through solid-liquid phase transitions, can efficiently capture and release thermal energy, but face the challenge of leakage during the phase change process. Inorganic PCMs, such as salt hydrates, offer high energy storage capacity, but are difficult to encapsulate due to their corrosive nature. Conventional encapsulation techniques for inorganic PCMs are limited, particularly for scalable applications. In this work, we present an innovative method for the encapsulation of salt hydrate-based inorganic PCMs (CaCl2\u00b76H2O) using co-axial electrospinning. The process involves the creation of co-axial fibers, with salt hydrate as the core and polymer (e.g., PVP) as the outer shell, effectively preventing leakage and improving the stability of the PCM. This approach demonstrates the potential for scalable microencapsulation of inorganic PCMs, marking the first report of using co-axial electrospinning for this purpose. This novel technique could contribute to enhancing the performance and applicability of PCMs in thermal energy storage systems and other energy efficiency applications."

    "research_summary": "The present paper comprises a detailed structural analysis of two novel compounds in the Sc-Co-Ga system: \u03c43-Sc50Co13Ga3 (space group Fm-3; \u03b5-Mg26-xAg7+x type), and \u03c44-Sc6Co1.73+x+yGa1-x (space group Immm; x=0.43; y=0.14; Ho6Co2Ga derivative type). Although alloys in the isothermal section are oxygen-free, the alloy of \u03c43, prepared for single crystal growth via partial melting in an alumina crucible, contained a minor amount of oxygen and can be considered as oxygen-stabilized Sc50Co13Ga3O1.1 (WDX-data). A search for homologous compounds in the systems Sc-{Pd,Pt}-Ga prompted the existence of two compounds Sc54{Pd,Pt,Ga}17, which from X-ray single crystal analyses proved both to be isotypic with the Hf54Os17-type structure (space group Immm). Whereas Sc54(Pd0.652Ga0.348)17 has a very limited homogeneity region at 850\u00b0C, Sc54(Pt1-xGax)17 exhibits at 850\u00b0C a large homogeneity region (0<x<0.28) extending from Ga-rich Sc76Pt17.2Ga6.8 Sc54(Pt0.72Ga0.28)17 to novel binary Sc54Pt17. Interestingly, against the usual trend of solution hardening, hardness, Young's modulus and fracture toughness all decrease with increasing Ga-content: this effect is less pronounced for Sc54(Pd1-xGax)17 than for Sc54(Pt1-xGax)17 and is in line with DFT calculations indicating a weakening of bonding with increasing Ga content, thereby overcompensating the solution hardening effect. DFT modeling showed a common bonding feature for all the studied compounds \u2013 a strong electron localization inside the Sc6 octahedra, stacking of which leads to the formation of Mackay icosahedra in Sc54(Pd1-xGax)17, Sc54(Pt1-xGax)17, and Sc50Co13Ga3. The band structure of Sc6Co2.25Ga0.625 and Sc50Co13Ga3 indicates their metallic behavior, while Sc54(Pd1-xGax)17 and Sc54(Pt1-xGax)17 show distinct semimetal features. All investigated compounds in this work show similar trends in Bader charge distribution with a positively charged Sc sublattice and a negatively charged sublattice formed by transition metals (Co, Pd, Pt) and Ga. The nickel-rich region of the system Ce-Ni-Si has been reinvestigated utilizing X-ray single-crystal, powder, and electron diffraction as well as electron microprobe and thermal analyses. Two novel hexagonal compounds, \u03c4-Ce<sub>20+<i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub>36+<i>y</i></sub>Si<sub>30-<i>z</i></sub> and \u03c4'-Ce<sub>30+<i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub>50+<i>y</i></sub>Si<sub>42-</sub><i><sub>z</sub>,</i> were identified. The crystal structure of \u03c4-Ce<sub>20+<i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub>36+<i>y</i></sub>Si<sub>30-<i>z</i></sub> was derived from single-crystal X-ray diffraction and found to be isotypic with the Sm<sub>10</sub>Ni<sub>20.8</sub>P<sub>15</sub>-type structure (S.G. <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub>/<i>m,</i> <i>x</i> = 1.8, <i>y</i> = 3.0, <i>z</i> = 1.8, <i>a</i> = 2.07156(2) nm, <i>c</i> = 0.39990(1) nm, <i>R</i><sub>F</sub> = 0.048). Rietveld refinement of \u03c4'-Ce<sub>30+<i>x</i></sub>Ni<sub>50+<i>y</i></sub>Si<sub>42-<i>z</i></sub> revealed isotypism with Tb<sub>15</sub>Ni<sub>28</sub>P<sub>21</sub> (S.G. <i>P</i>6<sub>3</sub>/<i>m</i>, <i>a</i> = 2.46926(13) nm, <i>c</i> = 0.40019(3) nm, <i>R</i><sub>F</sub> = 0.058). The compound Ce<sub>3</sub>Ni<sub>4</sub>Si<sub>2</sub> from X-ray single-crystal analysis was found to crystallize in a novel structure type with monoclinic unit cells (S.G. <i>C</i>2/<i>c</i>, <i>a</i> = 1.54708(3) nm, <i>b</i> = 0.58677(1) nm, <i>c</i> = 0.74331(1) nm, \u03b2 = 102.985(1)\u00b0, <i>R</i><sub>F</sub> = 0.017). This compound belongs to a new homologue series in the RE-Ni-Si system (RE = La and Ce) with general formula of RE<sub>(3\u00d72<sup><i>n</i></sup>)</sub>Ni<sub>(3\u00d72<sup><i>n</i></sup> + 1)</sub>Si<sub>(2<sup><i>n</i>+1</sup>)</sub>; <i>n</i> = 0,1, ..., \u221e. The crystal structure of this series is characterized by alternating numbers (2<sup><i>n</i></sup>) of corner-sharing Si-polyhedral blocks sandwiched between zigzag nickel chains. Higher-order members of this series are produced by the formation of more corner-sharing Si-polyhedral blocks due to removal of nickel chains. Investigation (electron microprobe and X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction analyses) of the phase relations in the Mn-rich corner (> 45 at.% Mn) of the systems Mn-{Ru,Os,Ir}-B, prompted in all three systems a ternary compound with formula (Mnx{Ru,Os,Ir}1-x)23B6. For the systems Mn-Ru-B, Mn-Ir-B phase equilibria have been determined at 950\u00b0C (Ru), 900\u00b0C (Ir) revealing in both cases a small homogeneity region at constant B-content (Mn1-xRux)23B6 (0.29 < x < 0.37); (Mn1-xOsx)23B6 (0.33 < x < 0.37), as well as (Mn1-xIrx)23B6 (0.29 < x < 0.34). The crystal structure of the three compounds was determined from single crystal and X-ray powder intensity data analyses to be isotypic with the Cr23B6-type (so-called tau-phase, space group Fm3\u00afm, No. 225). In all cases Mn atoms fully occupy the 4a site (0,0,0) at the origin of the unit cell. For the 8c site (\u00bc,\u00bc,\u00bc) we observed a random distribution of Mn1-x(PM)x with decreasing PM content (PM stands for a platinum metal atom) "

    "research_summary": "Autoregressive vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently demonstrated strong capabilities in robotic manipulation. However, their core process of action tokenization often involves a trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and inference efficiency. We introduce FASTer, a unified framework for efficient and generalizable robot learning that integrates a learnable tokenizer with an autoregressive policy built upon it. FASTerVQ encodes action chunks as single-channel images, capturing global spatio-temporal dependencies while maintaining a high compression ratio. FASTerVLA builds on this tokenizer with block-wise autoregressive decoding and a lightweight action expert, achieving both faster inference and higher task performance. Extensive experiments across simulated and real-world benchmarks show that FASTerVQ delivers superior reconstruction quality, high token utilization, and strong cross-task and cross-embodiment generalization, while FASTerVLA further improves overall capability, surpassing previous state-of-the-art VLA models in both inference speed and task performance. Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are promising materials for high-temperature applications. This study introduces an interpretable prediction model for the temperature-dependent yield strength of these alloys, utilizing a stacking ensemble algorithm. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test results ($$ P $$ = 0.873) confirm the model's reliability. Key features are analyzed from global and local perspectives using accumulated local effect (ALE) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) methods. The analysis reveals that an atomic size difference ($$ \\delta&gt;0.049 $$ ) and a bulk modulus (K &gt; 150) positively influence yield strength. Bivariate partial dependence plots (PDP) demonstrate that yield strength increases with both K and the shear modulus (G). At high temperatures (1, 000 and 1, 200 \u2103), the stacking model, combined with the Dung Beetle optimization algorithm, predicts improved yield strength in various alloy compositions. For example, the alloy Cr$$ _{0.275} $$ Nb$$ _{0.215} $$ Mo$$ _{0.349} $$ V$$ _{0.161} $$ shows a 19.90% improvement compared to the original dataset. Using parallel coordinate plots and iterative analysis, promising concentration regions for high yield strength were identified, such as in the Al-Cr-Nb-Mo-V system, where lower Al and Nb content and higher Cr content enhance performance. This DOE-EPSCoR project aimed to predict, synthesize, and characterize novel layered two-dimensional (2D) high-entropy materials (HEMs). These 2D-HEMs, composed of multiple principal elements in nearly equal concentrations, are distinct from traditional 2D materials (typically containing two or three elements) and conventional alloys (dominated by a single primary element with minor secondary additions). Their unique structural and compositional features enable significant lattice strain accommodation, resulting in enhanced electrode performance and potential applications in catalysis, hydrogen storage, sensing, quantum information technologies, and flexible electronics. The research focused on addressing four fundamental questions: (i) What combinations of elements can form stable and synthesizable 2D-HEMs? (ii) What mechanisms drive the stability and synthesizability of crystalline single-phase 2D-HEMs? (iii) How do local chemical disorder and defects influence the macroscopic electronic and mechanical properties? and (iv) What charge storage mechanisms are active in selectively synthesized 2D-HEMs for battery and supercapacitor electrode applications? To achieve these goals, the project employed an integrated theory-experiment approach, incorporating high-throughput first-principles calculations, theoretical modeling, data mining, experimental synthesis, and advanced characterization techniques. The advanced computing resources and state-of-the-art experimental characterization facilities at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) were leveraged through collaboration. Beyond scientific advancements, the project contributed to workforce development. Two postdoctoral researchers and three graduate students at the University of Maine were trained through co-advising by ORNL scientists and collaborative interactions, strengthening their expertise in cutting-edge materials science. Target detection is a fundamental task in radar sensing, serving as the precursor to any further processing for various applications. Numerous detection algorithms have been proposed. Classical methods based on signal processing, e.g., the most widely used CFAR, are challenging to tune and sensitive to environmental conditions. Deep learning-based methods can be more accurate and robust, yet usually lack interpretability and physical relevance. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that combines signal processing and deep learning by unfolding the CFAR detector with a state space model architecture. By reserving the CFAR pipeline yet tur"

    "research_summary": "Transition metal phosphides (TMPs) have aroused widespread research interest in the past decade due to their excellent electrical and mechanical properties. Nonetheless, their application in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS) has not been investigated. Here, we use density functional theory (DFT) to explore the potential of four transition-metal phosphides to act as contact materials of MEMS/NEMS switches. Specifically, we first investigate the thermodynamic stability of Ru2P, RuP, Rh2P, and TiP under an oxygen environment. Then, using benzene as the background gas, the mechanical contact cycle is modeled to examine the process of tribopolymer formation on the surface of the contacts, which has been reported as the major reason for conductance loss after repeated actuation. The results show that Ru2P and Rh2P are excellent choices for avoiding friction-induced polymerization, making them promising contact materials for MEMS/NEMS switches. An etch parameter study is conducted with the objective of achieving high anisotropy for tantalum (Ta) thin films of more than 1 \u03bcm in thickness. The gases explored are Argon (Ar), carbon tetrafluoride (CF4) and oxygen. The effects of composition, flow, pressure, and power are investigated. Optical emission spectroscopy is used to interpret the etch results. While the addition of oxygen adversely affects anisotropy, it is improved with lower pressure. An Ar:CF4 ratio of 5:1 is found to enable good etch rate and sidewall passivation. As power increases, the etch rate increases but there is no observable enhancement in anisotropy. Using a common parallel-plate RIE configuration with common low toxicity gases, a vertical sidewall is achieved for 2.5 \u03bcm thick \u03b1-Ta films with an optimum Ar to CF4 ratio, power and pressure.

    "research_summary": "Abstract Phase equilibria in the Li 2 O\u2012MnO x system was experimentally investigated under air condition and inert atmosphere (Ar). The experimental investigations for selected compositions of isothermally heat\u2010treated samples were performed using X\u2010ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X\u2010ray spectroscopy. Differential thermal analysis was used to determine the temperature of phase transformations. The thermodynamic parameters were optimized using the CALPHAD approach. Homogeneity ranges for cubic and tetragonal phases were reproduced and modeled in the framework of the compound energy formalism, while LiMnO 2 and Li 2 MnO 3 phases were treated as stoichiometric. Two\u2010sublattice partially ionic liquid model was employed to describe the liquid. Available thermodynamic properties were accounted during the optimization and the results reproduce them well. The calculated phase diagram agrees with the experimental data and it reproduces the equilibria within uncertainties. Abstract The interaction behavior between iron oxide\u2010bearing slags and carbon\u2010bonded MgO refractory (MgO\u2010C) containing calcium magnesium aluminate (CMA) was investigated at 1400\u00b0C, 1500\u00b0C, and 1600\u00b0C. After the iron oxide was reduced by the carbon from the MgO\u2010C refractory, a significant amount of MgO and metallic iron was observed to precipitate and disperse in the bulk of slag. During the iron oxide reduction process, the penetrative ability varied throughout the whole process, attributed to the effect of iron oxide on the thermophysical properties of the molten slag. No reduced iron was detected on the side of MgO\u2010C, which implies the slag penetration was primarily conducted after the iron oxide was reduced in the slag. Spinel was found to be predominantly formed during the interaction between MgO\u2010C refractory bearing CMA additive and slags, which strongly hindered further refractory corrosion. Additionally, the Ca 3 Al 4 MgO 10 phase is predicted via ThermoCalc and XRD. Abstract The stability of the LiMnO 2 phase and its thermodynamic properties plays a critical role in the development of cathode materials for lithium\u2010ion batteries and Li recycling by smelting reduction, where Li 2 O dissolves in the oxide slag based on CaO, Al 2 O 3 , and SiO 2 . In this study, for the first time, the heat capacity of the orthorhombic LiMnO 2 phase was experimentally determined using differential scanning calorimetry under argon flow. The classical three\u2010step method was employed, and sapphire was used for calibration. Comparisons with predictions based on the Neumann\u2013Kopp rule for oxides showed slight deviations over the temperature range investigated. Differential thermal analysis combined with gravimetry (thermogravimetric analysis) experiments were performed in air and argon atmospheres to support the analysis of microstructural changes. The results obtained in air showed that LiMnO 2 can be easily decomposed into cubic spinel and Li 2 MnO 3 on cooling. Investigation in Ar indicated that LiMnO 2 was stable up to 1330 K where it was possibly decomposed, but the reaction was reversible, and the same phases were found using x\u2010ray diffraction after cooling."

    "research_summary": "Additive manufacturing (AM) of bimetallic structures combining copper alloys and Ni-based superalloys is critical for extreme environmental applications. However, interface cracking during fabrication persists due to thermophysical property mismatches. By implementing a CALPHAD-based ICME framework (CALPHAD: Calculation of Phase Diagrams; ICME: Integrated Computational Materials Engineering), we decode nonequilibrium solidification and phase stability to predict cracking susceptibility. Liquid phase separation emerges as the dominant mechanism, altering solute redistribution and thermal stress accumulation - a previously underexplored factor in bimetallic systems. Experiments using wire arc additive manufacturing (WAAM) validate model prediction: crack-free interfaces between C18150 and In625 require intermediate layers with 65 wt.% In625. This composition mitigates cracking with the lowest cracking susceptibility coefficient (CSC). Importantly, we establish a quantitative correlation between phase separation and CSC, proposing a way to analyze systems exhibiting these microstructural features. This work uses ICME methodologies by linking thermochemical modeling to process optimization, offering new principles for designing defect-resistant bimetallic components in extreme environments such as rocket engine nozzles."

    "research_summary": "Two-dimensional (2D) magnetic materials with exotic magnetic properties have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in spintronics and data storage technologies. However, the limited availability of intrinsic 2D magnetic materials has driven efforts to induce and manipulate magnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic 2D systems through approaches such as chemical intercalation, defect engineering, and substitutional doping. Herein, we present a facile, <i>chimie douce</i> method for incorporating 3<i>d</i> transition metals (Cr, Co, and Ni) into the nonmagnetic PtSe<sub>2</sub> sublattice. This synthetic approach enables control over layer thickness of Pt<sub>1-<i>x</i></sub><i>M</i><sub><i>x</i></sub>Se<sub>2</sub> (<i>M</i> = Cr, Co, Ni) nanosheets by varying the <i>M</i> identity and annealing conditions. Comprehensive scattering and spectroscopic characterizations confirm the successful and homogeneous substitution of <i>M</i> atoms at the Pt site, rather than intercalation, and reveal a strong correlation between nanosheet thickness and the identity of the substituting metal. High-temperature annealing of the nanosheets promotes an irreversible transformation toward the bulk phase, allowing for detailed characterization of structural and magnetic properties. A case study of Pt<sub>0.8</sub>Cr<sub>0.2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> reveals that nanosheet thickness plays a critical role in modulating local magnetic interactions. While Cr atoms in the as-synthesized few-layers-thick nanosheets exhibit predominantly short-range antiferromagnetic interactions, the emergence of short-range ferromagnetic exchange is revealed in the bulk material. Detailed <i>ac</i> susceptibility and remanent magnetization measurements further demonstrate that bulk Pt<sub>0.8</sub>Cr<sub>0.2</sub>Se<sub>2</sub> adopts a frustrated magnetic ground state with clear signatures of ferromagnetic cluster-glass behavior. The systematic investigation presented herein establishes a clear and robust protocol for the synthesis and in-depth characterization of 2D transition-metal-substituted PtSe<sub>2</sub> materials with varying layer thickness and paves a path toward their realization in spintronic and magnetic device applications. Dicarbonyl[10,10-dimethyl-5,15-bis(pentafluorophenyl)biladiene]ruthenium(II), [Ru(C 33 H 16 F 10 N 4 )(CO) 2 ] or Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] , is the first reported ruthenium(II) cis -dicarbonyl tetrapyrrole complex. The neutral complex sports two carbonyls and an oligotetrapyrrolic biladiene ligand. Notably, the biladiene adopts a coordination geometry that is well distorted from square planar and much more closely approximates a seesaw arrangement. Accordingly, Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] is not only the first ruthenium cis -dicarbonyl with a tetrapyrrole ligand, but also the first metal biladiene complex in which the tetrapyrrole does not adopt a (pseudo-)square-planar coordination geometry. Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] is weakly luminescent, displaying \u03bb em = 552 nm upon excitation at \u03bb ex = 500 nm, supports two reversible 1 e \u2212 reductions at \u22121.45 and \u22121.73 V ( versus Fc + /Fc), and has significant absorption features at 481 and 531 nm, suggesting suitability for photocatalytic and photosensitization applications. While the structure of Ru(CO) 2 [DMBil1] was initially determined by X-ray diffraction, a traditionally acceptable quality structure could not be obtained (despite multiple attempts) because of consistently poor crystal quality. An independent structure obtained from electron diffraction experiments corroborates the structure of this unusual biladiene complex. A series of square planar metalloporphyrins (M(TPP), TPP is 5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrin and M(TPFPP), TPFPP is 5,10,15,20-tetrapentafluorophenylporphyrin; M is Zn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup>, Pd<sup>2+</sup>, or Pt<sup>2+</sup>) with distinct <i>meso</i>-substituents were prepared, and their magneto-optical activity (MOA) was characterized by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) and magneto-optical rotary dispersion spectroscopy (MORD; also known as Faraday rotation spectroscopy). MOA is crucial in the development of next-generation magneto-optical devices and quantum computing. The data show that the presence of <i>meso</i>-pentafluorophenyl substituents results in significant increase in MOA in comparison to the homologous phenyl group. Differences in the MOA of these metalloporphyrins are rationalized using the Gouterman four-orbital model and pave the way for rational design of improved and tailorable magneto-optical materials.

    "research_summary": "Describing the complex landscape of infinite-dimensional free energy is generally a challenging problem. This difficulty arises from the existence of numerous minimizers and, consequently, a vast number of saddle points. These factors make it challenging to predict the location of desired configurations or to forecast the trajectories and pathways leading from an initial condition to the final state. In contrast, experimental observations demonstrate that specific morphologies can be reproducibly obtained in high yield under controlled conditions, even amidst noise. This study investigates the possibility of elucidating the global structure of the free energy landscape and enabling the control of orbits toward desired minimizers without relying on exhaustive brute-force methods. Furthermore, it seeks to mathematically explain the efficacy of certain experimental setups in achieving high-yield outcomes. Focusing on the phase separation of two polymers in a solvent, we conduct a one-dimensional analysis that reveals the global free energy landscape and relaxation-parameter-dependent trajectory behaviors. Two key methodologies are developed: one is a saddle point search method, akin to bifurcation tracking. This method aims to comprehensively identify all saddle points. The other is a strategy that adjusts the relaxation parameters preceding each variable's time derivative, aligning with experimental setups. This approach enables control over trajectory behaviors toward desired structures, overcoming the limitations of steepest descent methods. By tuning these relaxation parameters, uncertainties in trajectory behavior due to inevitable fluctuations can be suppressed. These methodologies collectively offer a mathematical framework that mirrors experimental high-yield phenomena, facilitating a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. This study delves into the formation of nanoscale polyhedral block copolymer particles (PBCPs) exhibiting cubic, octahedral, and variant geometries. These structures represent a pioneering class that has never been fabricated previously. PBCP features distinct variations in curvature on the outer surface, aligning with the edges and corners of polyhedral shapes. This characteristic sharply contrasts with previous block copolymers (BCPs), which displayed a smooth spherical surface. The emergence of these cornered morphologies presents an intriguing and counterintuitive phenomenon and is linked to process parameters, such as evaporation rates and initial concentration, while keeping other variables constant. Using a system of coupled Cahn-Hillard (CCH) equations, we uncover the mechanisms driving polyhedral particle formation, emphasizing the importance of controlling relaxation parameters for shape variable <i>u</i> and microphase separation <i>v</i>. This unconventional approach, differing from traditional steepest descent method, allows for precise control and diverse polyhedral particle generation. Accelerating the shape variable <i>u</i> proves crucial for expediting precipitation and aligns with experimental observations. Employing the above theoretical model, we achieve shape predictions for particles and the microphase separation within them, which overcomes the limitations of ab initio computations. Additionally, a numerical stability analysis discerns the transient nature versus local minimizer characteristics. Overall, our findings contribute to understanding the complex interplay between process variables and the morphology of polyhedral BCP nanoparticles."

    "research_summary": "Abstract Background:Mosunetuzumab (Mosun) is a CD20xCD3 bispecific antibody with high efficacy in treatment of relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL). It is studied as first-line treatment alone or with lenalidomide (Len), an immunomodulator which may enhance T-cell effector function. However, full-dose Len is associated with frequent adverse events (AEs), while lower doses are effective in FL (Zucca et al, Blood 2019). In this multi-center, investigator-initiated trial, we studied the efficacy of Mosun with selectively applied, response-adapted, immune augmentation using low-dose Len, in previously untreated patients (pts) with FL or marginal zone lymphoma (MZL). Methods:Pts with high-burden FL or MZL requiring therapy received first-line subcutaneous Mosun for 8 planned cycles (C) with step-up dosing in C1 (day 1: 5mg, day 8 &amp; 15: 45 mg; then 45mg on day 1 of C2-C8). Pts who did not attain a complete response (CR) at interim response assessment (IRA) after C4 received Len (10mg daily, dosed continuously) during C5-C8. Primary response assessment occurred after C8, with an option to extend Mosun+Len to C12 in case of ongoing PR. The primary endpoint was CR rate (CRR) at end of treatment (EOT) using PET-CT Lugano or international splenic MZL criteria. Secondary objectives included safety, overall response rate (ORR), progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Len-induced immunomodulation was analyzed by peripheral blood flow cytometry and RNAseq on CD8+ T cells isolated by MACS microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Results:The trial completed enrollment with 52 pts (median age, 65 [range, 30-89]; 51% women), including 67% with FL and 33% with MZL (14% extranodal, 13% nodal/unspecified, 6% splenic). As of July 2025, 43 pts were evaluable for EOT response, which will be updated at the meeting. The most common AE's included injection site reaction (53%; grade [G] 1, 51%, G2, 2%), fatigue (45%; G\u22653, 1%), and rash (43%; G\u22653, 8%). Serious AE's (in 33% of pts) included cytokine release syndrome (CRS, 12%), abdominal pain (4%), and pneumonia (4%). Three pts discontinued treatment for toxicity (1 pneumonia; 1 CRS; 1 G4 hepatitis on Mosun+Len). CRS occurred in 14 pts (27%), all G1 and during C1. Two pts received tocilizumab and 2 received dexamethasone. CRS was associated with higher baseline lymphocyte count (P=0.042) and splenic MZL (2 of 3 pts). Len augmentation was administered to 17 pts (33%) who did not attain a CR at IRA after C4; 4 pts extended therapy to 12 cycles. Common AEs related to Len (in n=17 pts) included rash (24%), fatigue (18%), and neutropenia (18%; G3/4, 9%). The ORR was 86% (95% CI=72-95). The CRR was 84% (95%CI=69-93), 81% in FL and 88% in MZL. Minimal residual disease (MRD) by ctDNA (Roche Avenio NHL assay) was examined in 15 initial FL pts in CR, and 14 (93%) had undetectable ctDNA (median limit of detection 4.5x10\u207b5). With median follow up of 14 months (range, 2-35), PFS at 12 months is 87% (95%CI=73-94). Two pts died (one from transformed large B-cell lymphoma [LBCL], one from a neurodegenerative disorder). Of 6 pts with progression/early relapse events, 4 showed LBCL transformation, and CD20 expression was retained in 4 cases. At the time of IRA, pts who required Len augmentation had lower circulating NK cells (P=0.0021), HLADR+ T cells (P=0.04) and Tregs (P=0.0072) than those with early CR; these differences resolved at the EOT after Mosun + Len. RNAseq showed early (C2) upregulation of CD8+ T cell activation (TNFRSF9/4-1BB, IRF4, CD38, GZMB) and regulation (HAVCR2/TIM-3, CTLA4, LAG3, PDCD1) genes. However, at IRA we found no significant differentially expressed relevant genes in CD8+ T cells between pts with or without early CR. In pts who started Len augmentation, T cells at C6 showed upregulation of IFNG, RPTOR, ITK, KLRG1, and downregulation of CCR7, LEF1, TCF7, consistent with modulation towards effector memory states. Among 14 pts on Mosun+Len who reached EOT response evaluation, 11 (79%) attained CR while 3 had progressive disease (PD) with LBCL transformation. Conclusions:Fixed-duration Mosun with response-adapted low-dose Len augmentation attained a high CR rate, including MRD negativity, sparing most patients the toxicities of Len. Low-dose Len induced CD8\u207a T-cell effector reactivation but did not prevent progression in cases of occult LBCL transformation. Progression was not usually associated with CD20 antigen loss, suggesting immune evasion as an alternative resistance mechanism. Abstract Chemoresistance, primarily driven by leukemic stem cells (LSC), remains a major challenge in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). LSC exist within a highly specialized immune and non-hematopoietic bone marrow (BM) microenvironment that becomes altered throughout the progression of the disease. The mechanistic details of this crosstalk between LSC and their immune and non-immune bystander microenvironment cells remain poorly defined. To better understand the immune BM nich"

Although some approaches have shown promise in solving this problem via automation, they often rely on predetermined targets or are limited to simulated environments. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel real-time reinforcement learning approach for laser process control, implemented on a Field Programmable Gate Array to achieve real-time execution. Our experimental results from laser welding tests on stainless steel samples with a range of surface roughnesses validated the method's ability to adapt autonomously, without relying on reward engineering or prior setup information. Specifically, the algorithm learned the optimal power profile for each unique surface characteristic, demonstrating significant improvements over handengineered optimal constant power strategies - up to 23% better performance on rougher surfaces and 7% on mixed surfaces. This approach represents a significant advancement in automating and optimizing laser processes, with potential applications across multiple industries. The significant computational expenses associated with simulating the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process often restrict the insights gained from modeling endeavors to specific combinations of process parameters, hindering broader conclusions. In this study, we employ a classical Design of Experiments approach on results obtained by multiphase Finite Element simulations. Utilizing this framework, we derive quadratic metamodels for the dimensions of the melt pool, enabling predictions of melt pool width, depth, and length across a wide spectrum of processing conditions. Notably, our findings indicate that as few as 25 simulations can suffice to predict melt pool dimensions in conduction mode LPBF across varying laser power, velocity, initial temperature, and spot size parameters. Among other insights, the metamodels uncover and quantify the substantial influence of initial temperature (the local temperature of the volume preceding the laser interaction). Additionally, rare insights regarding the melt pool sensitivity towards the laser spot size are provided. Furthermore, our investigation delves into laser interactions with different phases (powder, liquid, solid) across diverse processing conditions to establish a net global absorption coefficient. These analyses underscore that, under conventional process conditions, most of the incident laser intensity falls onto the liquid phase during conduction mode LPBF simulations of 316L stainless steel and Ti-6Al-4V. However, the laser spot size significantly affects the laser intensity interacting with the liquid phase, warranting consideration of laser spot size dependent absorptivity values in part-scale models. Lastly, employing straightforward geometric simulations, we derive a full processing map predicting the occurrence of Lack of Fusion defects, based on calculated melt pool dimensions and the associated scanning strategy. Ensuring consistent processing quality is challenging in laser processes due to varying material properties and surface conditions.

The multi-flavor generalization of quasi-fermionic theories (fermions or critical scalars coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fields) is straightforward, but this is not true for quasi-bosonic theories (scalars or critical fermions coupled to Chern-Simons gauge fields). The latter theories have three flavor-singlet relevant operators and also three marginal operators, that become exactly marginal for infinite N c , but have a non-zero beta function at order 1 /N c . We compute the beta functions of these couplings in various weak coupling limits, and also discuss their general structure, generalizing previous computations for N f = 1. We find that IR-stable fixed points of the marginal couplings exist for some values of N f and of the \u2019t Hooft coupling \u03bb , but not for other values, and in one case we can explicitly follow how two pairs of fixed points merge and disappear as \u03bb is increased. We also analyze the \u201cSemi-Critical\u201d conformal field theories that arise when fine-tuning two (rather than three) relevant operators, and compute the beta function for their (single) marginal coupling constant.

We also analyze the ``Semi-Critical'' conformal field theories that arise when fine-tuning two (rather than three) relevant operators, and compute the beta function for their (single) marginal coupling constant. Effective string theory describes the physics of long confining strings in theories, like Yang-Mills theory, where the mass gap $M_{gap}^2$ is of the same order as the string tension $T$. In $2+1$ dimensions, there is a class of confining theories, including massive QED$_3$ as first analyzed by Polyakov, for which $M_{gap}^2\\ll T$. These theories are weakly coupled at low energies of order $M_{gap}$, and may be analyzed perturbatively. In this paper, we analyze the physics of strings in such theories, focusing on QED$_3$, at energies of order $M_{gap}$ (but still well below $\\sqrt{T}$). We argue that the width of the string in these theories should be of order $1/M_{gap}$ independently of its length, as long as the string is not exponentially long. We also compute at leading order in perturbation theory the ground state energy of a confining string on a circle, and the scattering of Nambu-Goldstone bosons on the string worldsheet. A bstract Large N quasi-fermionic Chern-Simons-matter theories have an approximate higher-spin symmetry that strongly constrains their correlation functions. In particular, the 3-point functions for generic spins are combinations of 3 structures (with specific dependence on the positions and helicities), and the coupling-dependence of the coefficient of each structure is uniquely determined. In the past few years, several relations between different structures were found. In this paper we show that all the relations between the structures follow from (or, conversely, they imply) a specific form written by Skvortsov for the vertices of the dual higher-spin gravity theory on four-dimensional anti-de Sitter space, when written in spinor-helicity variables. The dual bulk theory has a specific limit where it simplifies and becomes a \u201cchiral higher-spin gravity theory\u201d, and we discuss what can be said about this limit in the dual Chern-Simons-matter theories, where it involves an analytic continuation to complex couplings."

    "research_summary": "In an interconnected world, global challenges like climate change transcend borders, complicating governance as national interests often clash. Unregulated information flows fuel misinformation and erode trust in institutions. Today\u2019s governance resembles a complex puzzle, where addressing one issue may exacerbate another. The rise of e-commerce has transformed consumer purchasing behaviors and research, yet marketing lags in adapting to this shift, focusing on digital media rather than engaging consumers. This paper investigates how societal narratives and digital engagement can guide governance and marketing in a complex, interconnected world where trust in traditional institutions is declining. It introduces the Virtual Living Lab (VLL), a tool that analyzes social media, Big Data, and AI to track emerging public priorities and behavioral patterns. Research conducted in Japan and the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic reveals that well-being narratives play a vital role in shaping societal recovery and resilience. The findings emphasize that effective engagement requires not only relevant content but also emotional and contextual awareness, especially in times of uncertainty. As public perceptions of Well-Being evolve, particularly in Japan, organizations must ensure their messaging remains emotionally resonant and contextually relevant to foster behavioral change and promote healthier, more sustainable lifestyles. Introduction: The inherent challenge in learning radiography lies in the inability to confirm the correct positioning of a person until the resultant x-ray is examined. Spurious use of ionising radiation is unlawful and unethical, so radiography education has been limited to the teaching of theoretical concepts reinforced by practical placement learning. Latterly, the profession has introduced procedural simulation using radiographic phantoms or interactive electronic media [1], but immersive simulation involving patient journeys and procedures is uncommon due to the need to expose the subject to ionising radiation. Simulation in mammography education is further limited by the intimate nature of the procedures and the radiosensitivity of the breast. Immersive simulation, providing technical and non-technical learning has not been described in the literature, but we posited that it would be highly beneficial to learners, as breast imaging and interventional procedures require excellent communication and technical proficiency. We describe a pilot study undertaken to transform mammography education; whereby immersive simulation was used to follow a patient journey in a high-risk situation in breast imaging and advanced practice. Methods: The study involved 37 learners and a blended immersive simulation, whereby learners interacted with a human simulated person (SP) and a voiced manikin, when necessary, to remove risk of harm to the human SP. The manikin underwent an assessment of a breast mass involving different imaging modalities (Figure 1-A18) and communication challenges over 5 hours. Industry partners facilitated the simulation and academics facilitated learner debrief. Results: Anecdotal evidence was collected from all attendees. Learners suggested that the communication issues and techniques discussed during the event would be used in their future practice. Industry partners were enthusiastic about their inclusion and were keen to participate again. Discussion: Literature suggests the quality of the individual\u2019s experience during breast imaging is crucially dependent on the radiographer\u2019s interpersonal skills [2]. Performing radiological interventional procedures requires high haptic sensitivity and fine motor skills [3]. The pilot study garnered anecdotal feedback from learners suggesting that this method of teaching and learning satisfied both needs. Industry partners have since repeated the exercise for their application specialist trainees, suggesting that this also holds value for \u2018training the trainers\u2019 who teach those who use the equipment. In conclusion, it is possible to transform radiography education and include industry partners by using immersive simulation. The study continues to gather evidence to support the use of immersive simulation of this type for radiography education and for future research.

    "research_summary": "In the late 1990s, Los Alamos pursued a coaxial flux compression generator (FCG) concept that was described in several publications under the name 'Ranchero.' These FCGs were designed to be cost effective high current generators, and a variety of configurations were tested. The Ranchero armature is a 152 mm diameter aluminum cylinder with a 6 mm thick wall. The high explosive (HE) is detonated simultaneously on axis, and as the armature expands a factor of two, the wall thins to {approx}3 mm. At the final 300 mm diameter, the circumference is over 900 mm, and this should allow currents to be generated in the 90 MA range. No tests significantly over 50 MA have been performed but an experiment is planned. We have recently begun using Ranchero devices for a new application and we continue to improve the design. In this paper we describe recent tests of Ranchero and its subsystems. The load for our new application is an imploding aluminum liner that would deform due to the magnetic pressure applied during the initial flux loading. It will, however, implode properly when powered only during the {approx}29 {micro}s Ranchero flux compression time. This gives rise to a new system with explOSively formed fuse (EFF) opening switches and an integral closing switch that isolates the load. A capacitor bank delivers 2.8 MA to the Ranchero circuit in {approx}85 {micro}s. During this time, four parallel 63.5 mm wide EFFs, external to the coaxial system, complete the circuit. After armature motion begins, insulation which initially isolates the load is severed, connecting the load to the FCG in parallel with the EFFs. External HE charges are initiated on each of the EFFs to produce a resistance rise timed to not precede closure of the load isolation switch. The EFFs achieve significant resistance, and the flux remaining in the 191 nH generator and 3 nH transmission line is compressed to generate 30.85 MA in a {approx}12.5 nH static load. On three tests, the EFF system has operated flawlessly, and only {approx}100kA is driven back into the EFFs during peak voltage of the generator output. A test incorporating a 19.5 nH dual liner dynamic load has also been completed, and these results are also presented. Ranchero generators have been operated with armatures from 43 cm to 1.4 m long, corresponding to initial inductances from 56 to 191 nH. MHD code modeling gives better agreement with experiments using modules 43 cm long than the 1.4 m modules, and these results will also be presented. Problems of a magnetic universe and some, possible solutions: The greater the total energy of an astrophysical phenomena, the more restricted are the possible explanations. Magnetic energy is the most challenging because its origin is still considered problematic. We suggest that it is evident that the universe is magnetized because of radio lobes, extra galactic cosmic rays, an observed Faraday rotation measure, and the polarized emission of extra galactic radio structures. The implied energies are so large that only the formation of supermassive black holes, (SMBHs) at the center of every galaxy are remotely energetic enough to supply this immense energy, {approx} (1/10)10{sup 8} M{sub {circle_dot}}c{sup 2}. (Only a galaxy cluster of 1000 galaxies has comparable energy, but is inversely rare.) Yet this energy appears to be largely transformed into accelerated relativistic particles, both electrons and ions. Only a large-scale coherent dynamo within the accretion disk forming the massive black hole makes a reasonable starting point. The subsequent winding of this dynamo derived flux by conducting, angular-momentum-dominated accreting matter produces the immense, coherent magnetic fluxes. We imbed this explanation in a list of similar phenomena at smaller scale and look for physical consistency among the various phenomena, especially the conversion of force-free magnetic energy into acceleration. This project is developing a magnetically driven cylindrical confinement system for the creation of a small region of material existing under extreme conditions. Using a Ranchero High Explosive Pulsed Power generator (HEPP) with maximum current ranging from 25- 50 MA depending on the load, a current driven Al cylinder will impact a series of nested, less massive Au shells. Each subsequent shell's inner surface velocity will increase due to it's smaller mass by the ratio 2.01( 1+ m{sub i+ 1}/m i), along with radial convergence. Attaining this ideal result requires highly efficient energy transfer which in turn requires plastic cushions. The final velocity of the last sequential shell will be used to drive a central experimental package in which extreme material conditions will be produced. The inexpensive nature of HEPP and the extreme conditions attainable allow many studies to be conducted in regimes not currently available in the laboratory. One potential central experimental package consists of a cylindrical Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) target; "

    "research_summary": "A bstract We describe a novel variation of the mirror twin Higgs model in which the color gauge group in both sectors is extended to SU(4) c and spontaneously broken to SU(3) c exclusively in the visible sector. Through this process, the mirror Z 2 symmetry is spontaneously broken, allowing for a phenomenologically viable electroweak vacuum alignment. This structure produces interesting collider signatures, including heavy vectors and fermions with fractional electric charges. The twin sector, with unbroken SU(4) c , produces interesting cosmological characteristics, such as the possibility to reduce \u2206 N eff and stable spin-0 baryons. The enlarged top quark sector required by the extended color gauge symmetry preserves naturalness, with even less tuning than the original twin Higgs in many circumstances. The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposed extension of the HL-LHC program designed to exploit the unique scientific opportunities offered by the intense flux of high energy neutrinos, and possibly new particles, in the far-forward direction. Located in a well-shielded cavern 627 m downstream of one of the LHC interaction points, the facility will support a broad and ambitious physics program that significantly expands the discovery potential of the HL-LHC. Equipped with four complementary detectors -- FLArE, FASER$\u03bd$2, FASER2, and FORMOSA -- the FPF will enable breakthrough measurements that will advance our understanding of neutrino physics, quantum chromodynamics, and astroparticle physics, and will search for dark matter and other new particles. With this Letter of Intent, we propose the construction of the FPF cavern and the construction, integration, and installation of its experiments. We summarize the physics case, the facility design, the layout and components of the detectors, as well as the envisioned collaboration structure, cost estimate, and implementation timeline. We explore the diverse cosmological histories of a dark sector that is connected to the Standard Model (SM) via a Dirac sterile neutrino. The dark sector consists of a complex scalar and a Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) candidate protected by a global $U(1)$ stabilizing symmetry. Assuming the dark sector has negligible initial abundance and is populated from reactions in the SM thermal plasma during the radiation era, we show that the cosmological histories of the dark sector fall into four qualitatively distinct scenarios, each one characterized by the strengths of the portal couplings involving the sterile neutrino mediator. By solving Boltzmann equations, both semi-analytically and numerically, we explore these thermal histories and transitions between them in detail, including the time evolution of the temperature of the dark sector and the number densities of its ingredients. We also discuss how these various histories may be probed by cosmology, direct detection, indirect detection, collider searches, and electroweak precision tests."

    "research_summary": "TheMulti-Purpose Detector (MPD) is one of the three experiments of the Nuclotron Ion Collider-fAcility (NICA) complex, which is currently under construction at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna. With collisions of heavy ions in the collider mode, the MPD will cover the energy range \u221asNN = 4 \u2212 11 GeV to scan the high baryon-density region of the QCD phase diagram. With expected statistics of 50\u2013100 million events collected during the first run, MPD will be able to study a number of observables, including measurements of light hadrons and (hyper)nuclei production, particle flow, correlations and fluctuations, have a first look at dielectron production, and modification of vector-meson properties in dense matter. In this paper, we present selected results of the physics feasibility studies for theMPD experiment in Bi+Bi collisions at \u221asNN = 9.2 GeV, the system considered as one of the first available at the NICA collider. This study applies cutting-edge data mining and machine learning techniques to examine critical determinants of drug overdose death. Through the analysis of overdose-related data sets, the study aims to identify high-risk age groups, demographic clusters, and spatial mobility patterns associated with fatal drug consumption, namely fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and xylazine. Clustering algorithms such as KMeans and HDBSCAN are used to detect hidden demographic and geographic patterns, while classification models such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbors are employed to estimate substance use and identify major risk factors. Anomaly detection techniques are also employed to investigate outlier geographic displacement in overdose cases, which can offer insight into drug trafficking and drug tourism tendencies. The findings will guide evidence-based intervention strategies, strengthen the public health response, and guide policy to reduce the burgeoning drug overdose epidemic. Cyber spacing being harnessed as a foundation for global development and financial systems has posed increasing threats to organizational stability, compliance with regulations, and integrity of data. The report employs a two-pronged approach: firstly, assessing all threats and creating an organizational taxonomy for XYZ Company and getting into the details of vulnerabilities and trends of cyberattacks with the support of case studies like the Snowflake data breach and the Salt Typhoon campaign. Included here are ransomware, phishing, DDoS, and advanced persistent attacks. Secondly, an evaluation of how the implementations of cognitive computing platforms in IBM Watson and Palantir Foundry may mitigate financial risks arises. By contrasting their predictive analytics, compliance automation, capabilities for integration, and limitations, the research pinpoints the desirable context for each system deployment in the Malaysian regulatory environment. The analyses highlight the need for a multi-layered cybersecurity approach that embraces AI-driven solutions, employee training, and real-time detection of threats to guarantee the operational resilience of organizations while nationally aligning data protection efforts."

    "research_summary": "A knowledge of polarization properties of coherent radio waves escaping pulsar polar caps is crucial for calculating radiative transfer through the magnetosphere and for obtaining specific predictions of observable radio properties. We describe the pair cascades in the pulsar polar cap, and for the first time, determine the Stokes parameters of the escaping radio waves from first-principle kinetic simulations for a pulsar with an inclination angle of the magnetic axis 60\u00b0. Our model provides a quantitative and qualitative explanation of the observed pulsar radio powers and spectra, the pulse profiles and polarization curves, their temporal variability, the strong Stokes L and weak Stokes V polarization components, as well as the fact that linear polarization decreases with frequency and the non-existence of a radius to frequency relationship. We find that the radio emission from the polar cap can produce a diverse range of observed pulsar properties, including single or double peaked profiles. Most of the Stokes V curves from our simulations appear to be antisymmetric, but symmetric curves are also present at some viewing angles. Although the PA swing of the radiation from the polar cap can be fitted by the rotating vector model (RVM) for most viewing angles, the angles obtained from the RVM do not correspond to the angular distance of the observer from the magnetic axis. Instead, the PA is directly related to the plasma flows in the polar cap and not to the dipole geometry of the magnetic field. The observed range of other polarization features, in addition to our results, can be explained by propagation effects which are not part of the simulation. Our simulations demonstrate that pair discharges determine the majority of its typically observed properties. The usage of RVM for estimations of the magnetic field geometry from observations needs to be reevaluated. Ultralight axionlike particles (ALPs) can be a viable solution to the dark matter problem. The scalar field associated with ALPs, coupled to the electromagnetic field acts as an active birefringent medium, altering the polarization properties of light through which it propagates. In particular, oscillations of the axionic field induce monochromatic variations of the plane of linearly polarized radiation of astrophysical signals. The radio emission of millisecond pulsars provides an excellent tool to search for such manifestations, given their high fractional linear polarization and negligible fluctuations of their polarization properties. We have searched for evidence of ALPs in polarimetry measurements of pulsars collected and preprocessed for the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) campaign. Focusing on the twelve brightest sources in linear polarization, we searched for an astrophysical signal from axions using both frequentist and Bayesian statistical frameworks. For the frequentist analysis, which uses Lomb-Scargle periodograms at its core, no statistically significant signal has been found. The model used for the Bayesian analysis has been adjusted to accommodate multiple deterministic systematics that may be present in the data. A statistically significant signal has been found in the dataset of multiple pulsars with common frequencies between <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><a:msup><a:mn>10</a:mn><a:mrow><a:mo>\u2212</a:mo><a:mn>8</a:mn></a:mrow></a:msup></a:math> and <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" display=\"inline\"><c:mrow><c:mn>2</c:mn><c:mo>\u00d7</c:mo><c:msup><c:mrow><c:mn>10</c:mn></c:mrow><c:mrow><c:mo>\u2212</c:mo><c:mn>8</c:mn></c:mrow></c:msup><c:mtext> </c:mtext><c:mtext> </c:mtext><c:mi>Hz</c:mi></c:mrow></c:math>, which can most likely be explained by the residual Faraday rotation in the terrestrial ionosphere.

    "research_summary": "\u00a9 2019 The Author(s) We present the first asteroseismic results for \u03b4 Scuti and \u03b3 Doradus stars observed in Sectors 1 and 2 of the TESS mission. We utilize the 2-min cadence TESS data for a sample of 117 stars to classify their behaviour regarding variability and place them in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram using Gaia DR2 data. Included within our sample are the eponymous members of two pulsator classes, \u03b3 Doradus and SX Phoenicis. Our sample of pulsating intermediate-mass stars observed by TESS also allows us to confront theoretical models of pulsation driving in the classical instability strip for the first time and show that mixing processes in the outer envelope play an important role. We derive an empirical estimate of 74 per cent for the relative amplitude suppression factor as a result of the redder TESS passband compared to the Kepler mission using a pulsating eclipsing binary system. Furthermore, our sample contains many high-frequency pulsators, allowing us to probe the frequency variability of hot young \u03b4 Scuti stars, which were lacking in the Kepler mission data set, and identify promising targets for future asteroseismic modelling. The TESS data also allow us to refine the stellar parameters of SX Phoenicis, which is believed to be a blue straggler. Solar-like oscillations in red-giant stars are now commonly detected in thousands of stars with space telescopes such as the NASA Kepler mission. Parallel radial velocity and photometric measurements would help to better understand the physics governing the amplitudes of solar-like oscillators. Yet, most target stars for space photometry are too faint for light-demanding ground-based spectroscopy. The BRITE Constellation satellites provide a unique opportunity of two-color monitoring of the flux variations of bright luminous red giants. Those targets are also bright enough to be monitored with high-resolution spectrographs on small telescopes, such as the SONG Network. In these proceedings, we provide a first overview of our comprehensive, multi-year campaign utilizing both BRITE and SONG to seismically characterize Aldebaran, one of the brightest red giants in the sky. Because luminous red giants can be seen at large distances, such well-characterized objects will serve as benchmark stars for galactic archeology. ABSTRACT Linear damping rates and modal frequency corrections of radial oscillation modes in selected LEGACY main-sequence stars are estimated by means of a non-adiabatic stability analysis. The selected stellar sample covers stars observed by Kepler with a large range of surface temperatures and surface gravities. A non-local, time-dependent convection model is perturbed to assess stability against pulsation modes. The mixing-length parameter is calibrated to the surface-convection-zone depth of a stellar model obtained from fitting adiabatic frequencies to the LEGACY observations, and two of the non-local convection parameters are calibrated to the corresponding LEGACY linewidth measurements. The remaining non-local convection parameters in the 1D calculations are calibrated so as to reproduce profiles of turbulent pressure and of the anisotropy of the turbulent velocity field of corresponding 3D hydrodynamical simulations. The atmospheric structure in the 1D stability analysis adopts a temperature\u2013optical\u2013depth relation derived from 3D hydrodynamical simulations. Despite the small number of parameters to adjust, we find good agreement with detailed shapes of both turbulent pressure profiles and anisotropy profiles with depth, and with damping rates as a function of frequency. Furthermore, we find the absolute modal frequency corrections, relative to a standard adiabatic pulsation calculation, to increase with surface temperature and surface gravity."

    "research_summary": "Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to entropic order, whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles. We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\u03c0$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.

The fate of this theory in its strongly coupled regime has been debated extensively. Surprisingly, we find that gluing together the phase diagrams of two standard Wilson-Fisher <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><c:mrow><c:mi>O</c:mi><c:mo>(</c:mo><c:mn>4</c:mn><c:mo>)</c:mo></c:mrow></c:math> theories suffices to reproduce all the SPT phases, anomalies, and semiclassical limits.

Ordered phases of matter, such as solids, ferromagnets, superfluids, or quantum topological order, typically only exist at low temperatures. Despite this conventional wisdom, we present explicit local models in which all such phases persist to arbitrarily high temperature. This is possible since order in one degree of freedom can enable other degrees of freedom to strongly fluctuate, leading to \"entropic order\", whereby typical high energy states are ordered. Our construction, which utilizes interacting bosons, avoids existing no-go theorems on long-range order or entanglement at high temperature. We propose a simple model for high-temperature superconductivity using these general principles. A bstract We reconsider the problem of electrically charged, massless fermions scattering off magnetic monopoles. The interpretation of the outgoing states has long been a puzzle as, in certain circumstances, they necessarily carry fractional quantum numbers. We argue that consistency requires such outgoing particles to be attached to a topological co-dimension 1 surface, which ends on the monopole. This surface cannot participate in a 2-group with the magnetic 1-form symmetry and is often non-invertible. Equivalently, the outgoing radiation lies in a twisted sector and not in the original Fock space. The outgoing radiation therefore not only carries unconventional flavor quantum numbers, but is often trailed by a topological field theory. We exemplify these ideas in the 1+1 dimensional, chiral 3450 model which shares many of the same features. We comment on the effects of gauge field fluctuations on the lowest angular momentum fermion scattering states in the presence of a magnetic monopole. While, to leading order, these zero modes can penetrate into the monopole core, in the full theory some of the zero modes are lifted and develop a small centrifugal barrier. The dynamics of the zero modes is that of a multi-flavor Schwinger model with a space-dependent gauge couplin"

A bstract We uncover a new gravitational-wave production mechanism in cosmological, first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory and compute the resulting gravitational-wave spectrum. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be preceded by a period of thermal inflation. We present an analysis of the role that the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) resolution length, the minimal distance by which two nearby colored charges in a jet must be separated such that they engage with the plasma independently, plays in understanding the modification of jet substructure due to interaction with QGP. The shorter the resolution length of QGP, the better its resolving power. We identify a set of observables that are sensitive to whether jets are quenched as if they are single energetic colored objects or whether the medium that quenches them has the ability to resolve the internal structure of the jet. Using the hybrid strong/weak coupling model, we find that although the ungroomed jet mass is not suitable for this purpose (because it is more sensitive to effects coming from particles reconstructed as a part of a jet that originate from the wake that the jet leaves in the plasma), groomed observables such as the number of Soft Drop splittings nSD, the momentum sharing fraction zg, or the groomed jet mass are particularly well-suited to discriminate the degree to which the QGP medium resolves substructure within a jet. In order to find the optimal grooming strategy, we explore different cuts in the Lund plane that allow for a clear identification of the regions of Soft Drop phase space that enhance the differences in the jet substructure between jets in vacuum and quenched jets. Comparison with present data seems to disfavor an \u201cinfinite resolution length\u201d, which is to say the hypothesis that the medium interacts with the jet as if it were a single energetic colored object. Our analysis indicates that as the precision of experimental measurements of jet substructure observables and the control over uncertainties in their calculation improves, it will become possible to use comparisons like this to constrain the value of the resolution length of QGP, in addition to seeing how the substructure of jets is modified via their passage through it. Relativistic, charged, superheated bubbles may play an important role in neutron star mergers if first-order phase transitions are present in the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics. We describe the properties of these bubbles in the hydrodynamic regime. We find two qualitative differences wi"

    "research_summary": "Context. Because Cepheid variable stars have long been used as a cosmic benchmark for scaling distances in our Galaxy and beyond, the accuracy of stellar evolution models for Cepheids have wide-reaching effects. However, our understanding of the dynamics in the interiors of these physically complex stars is limited. Aims. Our goal is to provide a detailed multi-dimensional picture of hydrodynamic convection and convective boundary mixing in the interior of Cepheids. Methods. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we studied the structure of intermediate-mass stars that cross the instability strip. Then, we performed two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of six stars with the fully compressible Multidimensional Stellar Implicit Code ( MUSIC ). Our simulations did not model the radial pulsations but focused on the interior structure of this family of stars. We developed and applied a new statistical analysis to examine convection and convective boundary mixing in the interior of these stellar simulations. Results. Based on a grid of MESA models, we demonstrated that a common structure for intermediate mass Cepheids includes an interior convective shell as well as a thin outer convective envelope. Using the extreme value theory approach to analyze our MUSIC simulation data, we found that overshooting above the convective shell fills the space between these convectively unstable layers. We developed a new statistical analysis that provides a clearer picture of how overshooting fills this layer; it also allowed us to formulate a detailed comparison between overshooting above and below the convective shell. Our analysis effectively decomposes the overshooting layer into two layers: a weak overshooting layer and a strong overshooting layer. Statistically, this is accomplished by decomposing the strongly non-Gaussian probability density function into a mixture of gamma distributions. Using our mixture model, we showed that the ratio of overshooting lengths above and below the convective shell depends directly on the radial extent of the convective shell as well as its depth in the star. We proposed a new form for the diffusion coefficient that addresses the need for overlapping overshooting layers between convective shells. We introduced the idea of a \u201csuper-mixing layer\u201d where overshooting from both the convective shell and the convective envelope results in efficient mixing and could be viewed as merging the two adjacent convective zones. Deneb, the prototype Alpha Cygni variable, is a bright A2 Ia supergiant which shows irregular variability with a 12-day quasi-period, presumed to be caused by pulsations. At the 2023 AAVSO Annual Meeting we discussed radial velocity and photometry data from several sources showing that the 12-day variations begin abruptly at an arbitrary phase, damp out after several cycles, and resume at intervals of around 75 days. Additional data with more frequent time sampling and longer time series were needed to verify the existence and precision of the 75-day interval. We have identified additional data sets and have intensified ground-based observing programs. Here we present analysis of 1) an 8.6-year photometric data set from the Solar Mass Ejection Imager; 2) BRITE Constellation light curves from six observing seasons of 60 to 180 days each, 2014-2021; 3) 4.6 years of radial velocity data from Morrison; 4) 1.4 years of radial velocity data from Eaton; and 5) additional V-band photometry from the AAVSO Photoelectric Photometry (PEP) section. Examining the SMEI data set, we find a most common 100 to 125 day interval between `pulsation' resumptions. These resumptions sometimes skip intervals. We also find sudden large excursions in brightness and radial velocity which are distinct from the `pulsation' resumptions and may or may not be data artifacts. We point out changes in the average level of Deneb's radial velocity which appear to be real given the accuracy of the measurements but are not explained. Using the atmospheric pulsation code written by George Bowen, we have performed a parameter study examining the effects of modifying various parameters of models of oxygen-rich AGB atmospheres pulsating in the fundamental and first-overtone modes. For each pulsation mode, we have examined the effects of adjusting the dust condensation temperature, dust condensation temperature range, pulsation amplitude, dust opacity, and metallicity. Our model grids are generated with the constraint that their luminosities are chosen to span the range of observed mass loss rates at a chosen mass. The dust condensation temperature, pulsation amplitude, and dust opacity have strong effects on the ultimate location and shape of the final model grids in the mass luminosity plane. The mass loss rate evolution of the fundamental and first-overtone mode models show a significant difference in behavior. While the fundamental mode models exhibit the typically assumed power\u2013law relati"

    "research_summary": "Abstract The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument provides continuous, high\u2010resolution observations of atmospheric pollutants over North America from geostationary orbit. This study introduces an on\u2010orbit spectral calibration algorithm implemented in the TEMPO Version 3 Level 0\u20131 processor, covering both operational irradiance and radiance wavelength calibrations and offline slit function retrievals. Irradiance wavelength calibration accuracy was evaluated, with the TSIS\u20101 hybrid solar reference spectrum chosen due to its low fitting residuals. Accordingly, first\u2010 and second\u2010order Chebyshev\u2010polynomial fittings are applied to UV and VIS, respectively, to derive the wavelength grid. Earth\u2010view radiance wavelength calibration updates the wavelength grid based on the latest solar irradiance calibration result by fitting a wavelength shift. To optimize efficiency and accuracy, a narrow spectral window of 100 channels (320\u2013340 nm for UV and 630\u2013650 nm for VIS) was selected, with wavelength shift uncertainties of 0.002 nm (UV) and 0.006 nm (VIS). Radiance calibration results shows that the wavelength shifts of inhomogeneous pixels vary relatively significantly. We perform a 22\u2010month trend analysis of the TEMPO solar irradiance spectral performance. Compared to first light, the wavelength shift gradually increases, reaching 0.08\u20130.09 nm in July 2024, and then remains stable. The offline slit function parameters, retrieved from several narrow spectral windows using a super\u2010Gaussian function, show minor variations during the 22\u2010month on\u2010obit operation and did not deviate significantly from prelaunch. This study supports the long\u2010term L1b data processing for TEMPO and provides an instrument spectral calibration framework applicable for future geostationary orbit spectrometers. Abstract The Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution (TEMPO) instrument is the first spaceborne hyperspectral spectrometer that measures backscattered sunlight over North America in a geostationary orbit. The two charge\u2010coupled device (CCD) detectors of TEMPO, with spectral coverages of 293\u2013494 and 538\u2013741 nm and resolutions of 0.53\u20130.63 nm, are capable of identifying absorption features of key trace gases, including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, and others. Using a step\u2010and\u2010stare scanning mechanism, the TEMPO instrument measures backscattered Earth radiance spectra hourly during the middle of the day (nominal scans) and every 40 min in the early morning and late afternoon (optimized scans) to effectively cover the sunlit portions of the continent, with scans during twilight when permitted by instrument safety constraints. Solar irradiance measurements are also conducted nominally with a weekly frequency. This article describes the Version 3 algorithm for TEMPO Level 1b data processing, which provides radiometrically and spectrally calibrated solar irradiance and Earth radiance spectra as the primary outputs. The processing includes the conversion of digitized Level\u20100 signals to radiance or irradiance, image navigation and registration for Earth spectra, and spectral calibration. This article also discusses calibration key data derived from pre\u2010launch instrument characterization and in\u2010flight calibration results. Abstract Equatorial atmospheric waves provide a mechanism for variability on a wide range of timescales and for disturbances in one part of the tropics to influence other tropical locations around the globe. A Mars general circulation model is used to investigate how equatorial waves behave under different atmospheric dust loading scenarios and when perturbed by dust storms. Such waves may be important for understanding triggering of distant dust storms or additional dust lifting centers within large storms. Equatorial waves appear to change when dust storm sequences cross the equator or when background dust amounts significantly vary, with eastward- and westward-propagating waves within a wide spectral interval being amplified in general. Specifically, many low-frequency, long-wavelength equatorial waves become prominent during prescribed dust storm episodes. Their horizontal wave structures seen in the 100 Pa geopotential field show a resemblance to equatorial Rossby, Kelvin, and mixed Rossby\u2013gravity waves. Waves with different wave periods and zonal wavenumbers evolve with time and interfere with each other, leading to complex time-dependent eddy patterns. This study shows that both dust storms and background dust can significantly influence the spectra and structures of eddies in the tropical Martian atmosphere."

    "research_summary": "Context. The proper plasma analysis practice (PPAP) method has been proposed to analyze spectroscopic data of ionized nebulae. The method is based on a coherent and simultaneous determination of the reddening correction and physical conditions in nebulae. The PPAP method\u2019s creators reanalyzed the results of nine of the brightest planetary nebulae in M31. They claim that, if standard values of the physical conditions are used to compute the extinction instead of their proposed method, extinction correction is underestimated by more than 50%, and hence, ionic and elemental abundance determinations, especially the N/O ratio, are incorrect. Aims. The discrepancies between the two methods are investigated. Methods. Several tests were performed to assess the accuracy of the non-PPAP results when determining: (i) the interstellar extinction coefficient, (ii) the plasma electron temperature and density, and (iii) the ionic abundances, in particular of singly ionized nitrogen. In the last case, the ionic N + /H + abundance was recalculated using both H \u03b1 and H \u03b2 as the reference H I emissivity. Results. The analysis shows that the errors introduced by adopting standard values of the plasma conditions are small, within the uncertainties. On the other hand, the interstellar extinction determined using the PPAP method (uncritically making use of all available Paschen and Balmer lines, without considering observational, random and/or systematic effects) is found to be overestimated for five of the nine nebulae considered. This has consequences for the subsequent analysis of the physical and chemical properties of the nebulae and their progenitors. The python notebook used to generate all the results presented in this Letter is publicly available at a GitHub repository. Conclusions. The initial, non-PPAP results and conclusions are proven valid. Although the PPAP method is, in principle, a recommended practice, we insist that it is equally important to critically assess which H I lines are included in the determination of the interstellar extinction coefficient, and to make sure that physical results are obtained for the non-de-reddened line ratios. Ueta &amp; Otsuka (2021) proposed a method, named as the \"Proper Plasma Analysis Practice\", to analyze spectroscopic data of ionized nebulae. The method is based on a coherent and simultaneous determination of the reddening correction and physical conditions in the nebulae. The same authors (Ueta &amp; Otsuka 2022, UO22) reanalyzed the results of Galera-Rosillo et al. (2022, GR22) on nine of the brightest planetary nebulae in M31. They claim that, if standard values of the physical conditions are used to compute the extinction instead of their proposed method, extinction correction is underestimated by more than 50% and hence, ionic and elemental abundance determinations, especially the N/O ratio, are incorrect. Several tests were performed to assess the accuracy of the results of GR22, when determining: i) the extinction coefficient, ii) the electron temperature and density, and iii) the ionic abundances. In the latter case, N+ /H+ ionic abundance was recalculated using both H_alpha and H_beta as the reference H I emissivity. The analysis shows that the errors introduced by adopting standard values of the plasma conditions by GR22 are small, within their quoted uncertainties. On the other hand, the interstellar extinction in UO22 is found to be overestimated for five of the nine nebulae considered. This propagates into their analysis of the properties of the nebulae and their progenitors. The python notebook used to generate all the results presented in this paper are of public access on a Github repository. The results from GR22 are proven valid and the conclusions of the paper hold firmly. Although the PPAP is, in principle, a recommended practice, we insist that it is equally important to critically assess which H I lines are to be included in the determination of the interstellar extinction coefficient, and to assert that physical results are obtained for the undereddened line ratios. Context. The planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) is a standard candle that comprises a key rung on the extragalactic distance ladder. The method is based on the empirical evidence that the luminosity function of planetary nebulae (PNe) in the [O III ] \u03bb 5007 nebular emission line reaches a maximum value that is approximately invariant with population age, metallicity, or host galaxy type. However, the presence of bright PNe in old stellar populations is not easily explained by single-star evolutionary models. Aims. To gain information about the progenitors of PNe at the tip of the PNLF, we obtained the deepest existing spectra of a sample of PNe in the galaxy M 31 to determine their physico-chemical properties and infer the post-asymptotic giant branch (AGB) masses of their central stars (CSs). Precise chemical abundances allow us to confront the theoretical yields for AGB stellar m"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as \u201cbones,\u201d which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths \u223c20 to &gt;100 pc, widths \u223c1\u20132 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy Legacy program FIlaments Extremely Long and Dark: a Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS), we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be \u223c30\u2013150 \u03bc G at parsec scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may slow and guide gas flow during dissipation. Recent star formation within the bones may be due to high-density pockets at smaller scales, which could have formed before or simultaneously with the bones. Abstract Polarization observations of the Milky Way and many other spiral galaxies have found a close correspondence between the orientation of spiral arms and magnetic field lines on scales of hundreds of parsecs. This paper presents polarization measurements at 214 \u03bc m toward 10 filamentary candidate \u201cbones\u201d in the Milky Way using the High-resolution Airborne Wide-band Camera on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy. These data were taken as part of the Filaments Extremely Long and Dark: A Magnetic Polarization Survey and represent the first study to resolve the magnetic field in spiral arms at parsec scales. We describe the complex yet well-defined polarization structure of all 10 candidate bones, and we find a mean difference and standard deviation of \u221274\u00b0 \u00b1 32\u00b0 between their filament axis and the plane-of-sky magnetic field, closer to a field perpendicular to their length rather than parallel. By contrast, the 850 \u03bc m polarization data from Planck on scales greater than 10 pc show a nearly parallel mean difference of 3\u00b0 \u00b1 21\u00b0. These findings provide further evidence that magnetic fields can change orientation at the scale of dense molecular clouds, even along spiral arms. Finally, we use a power law to fit the dust polarization fraction as a function of total intensity on a cloud-by-cloud basis and find indices between \u22120.6 and \u22120.9, with a mean and standard deviation of \u22120.7 \u00b1 0.1. The polarization, dust temperature, and column density data presented in this work are publicly available online. Polarization-mode observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) are powerful tools for studying the dust grain populations in circumstellar disks. Many sources exhibit polarization signatures consistent with aligned dust grains, yet the physical origin of this alignment remains uncertain. One such source is BHB07-11, a Class I protobinary object in the Pipe Nebula with complex spiral arm structures in its circumbinary disk. While magnetic fields are often invoked to explain grain alignment in the interstellar medium, the contrasting conditions in circumstellar disk environments demand further investigation into grain alignment mechanisms. To determine BHB07-11's dominant polarization mechanism, we leverage ALMA polarization-mode dust continuum observations in Bands 3 ($\u03bb$=3.1 mm), 6 ($\u03bb$=1.3 mm), and 7 ($\u03bb$=0.87 mm), in combination with high-resolution dust continuum and spectral line observations in Band 6. Observed polarization vectors in each band are consistent with emission from aligned grains and follow the structure of the spiral arms as shown in the high-resolution observations. Given the relationship between the observed polarization vector orientation and the spiral arms, we find that the polarization morphology is most consistent with grains aligned through a relative velocity flow between gas and dust in the spiral arms, as envisioned in the recently developed badminton birdie-like alignment mechanism, rather than alignment with a magnetic field or other known alignment mechanisms. Abstract Magnetic fields influence the structure and evolution of protostellar systems; thus, understanding their role is essential for probing the earliest stages of star formation. We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 3 and 6 polarized continuum observations at \u223c0 <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1"

    "research_summary": "Abstract Galaxy clusters are expected to be both dark matter (DM) reservoirs and storage rooms for the cosmic-ray protons (CRp) that accumulate along the cluster's formation history. Accordingly, they are excellent targets to search for signals of DM annihilation and decay at \u03b3 -ray energies and are predicted to be sources of large-scale \u03b3 -ray emission due to hadronic interactions in the intracluster medium (ICM). In this paper, we estimate the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) to detect diffuse \u03b3 -ray emission from the Perseus galaxy cluster. We first perform a detailed spatial and spectral modelling of the expected signal for both the DM and the CRp components. For each case, we compute the expected CTA sensitivity accounting for the CTA instrument response functions. The CTA observing strategy of the Perseus cluster is also discussed. In the absence of a diffuse signal (non-detection), CTA should constrain the CRp to thermal energy ratio X 500 within the characteristic radius R 500 down to about X 500 &lt; 3 \u00d7 10 -3 , for a spatial CRp distribution that follows the thermal gas and a CRp spectral index \u03b1 CRp = 2.3. Under the optimistic assumption of a pure hadronic origin of the Perseus radio mini-halo and depending on the assumed magnetic field profile, CTA should measure \u03b1 CRp down to about \u0394\u03b1 CRp \u2243 0.1 and the CRp spatial distribution with 10% precision, respectively. Regarding DM, CTA should improve the current ground-based \u03b3 -ray DM limits from clusters observations on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross-section by a factor of up to \u223c 5, depending on the modelling of DM halo substructure. In the case of decay of DM particles, CTA will explore a new region of the parameter space, reaching models with \u03c4 \u03c7 &gt; 10 27 s for DM masses above 1 TeV. These constraints will provide unprecedented sensitivity to the physics of both CRp acceleration and transport at cluster scale and to TeV DM particle models, especially in the decay scenario. Neutrinos from a Galactic core collapse supernova can undergo elastic scattering with electrons in xenon atoms in liquid xenon based dark matter detectors giving rise to electrons of kinetic energy up to a few MeV. We calculate the scattered electron spectrum and the number of such elastic scattering events expected for a typical Galactic core collapse supernova in a xenon target. Although the expected number of events is small (compared to, for example, inelastic neutrino-nucleus charged current interaction with xenon nuclei, that also gives rise to final state electrons), the distinct spectral shape of the scattered electrons may allow identification of the elastic scattering events. Further, while the process is dominated by neutrinos and antineutrinos of electron flavor, it receives contributions from all the six neutrino species. Identification of the electron scattering events may, therefore, allow an estimation of the relative fractions of the total supernova explosion energy going into electron flavored and non-electron flavored neutrinos. Abstract The nature of dark matter and properties of neutrinos are among the most pressing issues in contemporary particle physics. The dual-phase xenon time-projection chamber is the leading technology to cover the available parameter space for weakly interacting massive particles, while featuring extensive sensitivity to many alternative dark matter candidates. These detectors can also study neutrinos through neutrinoless double-beta decay and through a variety of astrophysical sources. A next-generation xenon-based detector will therefore be a true multi-purpose observatory to significantly advance particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, solar physics, and cosmology. This review article presents the science cases for such a detector. It is known that neutrinos from supernova (SN) bursts can potentially give rise to nuclear recoil (NR) signals arising from the neutral current (NC) process of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\\mathrm{CE}\\ensuremath{\\nu}\\mathrm{NS}$) interactions of the neutrinos with xenon nuclei in future, large (multiton scale) liquid xenon (LXe) detectors employed for dark matter searches, depending on the SN progenitor mass and distance to the SN. In this paper, we show that the same detectors will also be sensitive to inelastic charged-current (CC) interactions of the SN electron neutrinos (${\\ensuremath{\\nu}}_{e}\\mathrm{CC}$) with xenon nuclei. Such interactions, while creating an electron in the final state, also leave the postinteraction target nucleus in an excited state, the subsequent deexcitation of which produces, among other particles, $\\ensuremath{\\gamma}$ rays and neutrons. The electron and deexcitation $\\ensuremath{\\gamma}$ rays will give ``electron recoil'' (ER) type signals, while the deexcitation neutrons---the so-called ``neutrino-induced neutrons'' (${\\ensuremath{\\nu}}_{e}\\mathrm{In}$)---produce, through their multiple scattering on the xenon nuc"

Muon-based facilities offer a unique potential to provide capabilities at both the Intensity Frontier with Neutrino Factories and the Energy Frontier with Muon Colliders ranging from the Higgs energy to the multi-TeV energy range. They rely on novel technology with challenging parameters, for which the feasibility is currently being assessed by the U.S. Muon Accelerator Program (MAP) [1]. A realistic scenario for a complementary series of staged facilities with increasing complexity and significant physics potential at each stage has been developed. It takes advantage of and leverages the capabilities already planned at Fermilab, especially Project X and LBNE. Each stage is defined in such a way as to provide an R&amp;D platform to validate the technologies required for subsequent stages. The rationale and sequence of a realistic staging process are presented. A muon collider would enable the big jump ahead in energy reach that is needed for a fruitful exploration of fundamental interactions. The challenges of producing muon collisions at high luminosity and 10~TeV centre of mass energy are being investigated by the recently-formed International Muon Collider Collaboration. This Review summarises the status and the recent advances on muon colliders design, physics and detector studies. The aim is to provide a global perspective of the field and to outline directions for future work. &lt;p&gt;A muon collider would enable the big jump ahead in energy reach that is needed for a fruitful exploration of fundamental interactions.

An increased level of R&amp;D effort is justified at the current time, because the muon collider promises an alternative path toward high-energy, high-luminosity lepton collisions that extends beyond the expected reach of linear colliders. The strong suppression of synchrotron radiation compared to electrons allows beam acceleration in rings making efficient use of the RF systems for acceleration. The overall power consumption of a 10 TeV MC is expected to be lower than that of CLIC at 3 TeV. Additionally the beam can repeatedly produce luminosity in two detectors in the collider ring. The ratio of luminosity to beam power is expected to improve with collision energy, a unique feature of the MC. The compactness of the collider makes it plausible that a cost effective design might be achieved; however this must be verified with more detailed estimates. If the technical challenges can be overcome, the MC offers a potential route to long-term sustainability of collider physics."

    "research_summary": "It has been suggested that the Plane of Satellites (PoS) phenomenon may imply a tension with current $\u039b$CDM cosmology since a Milky-Way (MW)-like PoS is very rare in simulations. In this study, we analyze a large sample of satellite systems of MW-like galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyze their spatial aspect ratio, orbital pole dispersion, Gini coefficient, radial distribution, and bulk satellite velocity relative to the host galaxy. These are compared to the observed Milky~Way PoS. We identified galaxy samples in two mass ranges ($0.1 - 0.8 \\times 10^{12} $ M$_\\odot$ and $0.8 - 3.0 \\times 10^{12}$ M$_\\odot$). We find for both mass ranges that only $\\sim$ 1 percent of MW-like galaxies contain a PoS similar to that of the MW. Nevertheless, these outliers occur naturally in $\u039b$CDM cosmology. We analyze the formation, environment, and evolution of the PoS for nine systems that are most MW-like. We suggest that a PoS can form from one or more of at least five different processes. A massive Magellanic~Cloud (MC)-like satellite is found in 1/3 of the systems and probably plays an important role in the PoS formation. We find a tendency for about half of the satellites to have recently arrived at $z &lt; 0.5$, indicating that a MW-like PoS is a recent and transient phenomenon. We also find that a spin up of the angular momentum amplitude of the most massive satellites is an indicator of the recent in-fall of the PoS satellites. We investigate photon, pion, and rho-meson production from proton synchrotron radiation in the presence of strong magnetic fields. The proton decay widths and the luminosities of the emitted particles are calculated within a relativistic quantum framework that incorporates Landau quantization. A scaling rule is derived for the transition probability between different Landau levels. This allows an evaluation of transitions for extremely high Landau numbers exceeding $10^{15}$. Furthermore, we calculate the momentum distribution of the emitted particles by properly including the proton recoil effect associated with particle emission. The results differ significantly from conventional semiclassical approaches. We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \\ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \\approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $&gt; 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^&gt;_\\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius."

    "research_summary": "We detail an innovative new technique for measuring the 2-D velocity moments (rotation velocity, velocity dispersion and Gauss-Hermite coefficients h3 and h4) using spectra from Keck DEIMOS multi-object spectroscopic observations. The data are used to reconstruct 2-D rotation velocity maps.Here we present data for one of five early-type galaxies whose kinematics we have measured out to ~3 effective radii (see [1]). From these data 2D kinematic maps are constructed. We show such analyses can provide significant insights into the global kinematic structure of galaxies, and, in some cases, challenge the accepted morphological classification. Our results are of particular importance to studies which attempt to classify galaxies by their kinematic structure within one effective radius, such as the recent definition of fast- and slow- rotator classes by the SAURON project. Here we test the idea that new globular clusters (GCs) are formed in the same gaseous ('wet') mergers or interactions that give rise to the young stellar populations seen in the central regions of many early-type galaxies. We compare mean GC colors with the age of the central galaxy starburst. The red GC subpopulation reveals remarkably constant mean colors independent of galaxy age. A scenario in which the red GC subpopulation is a combination of old and new GCs (formed in the same event as the central galaxy starburst) cannot be ruled out, although this would require an age-metallicity relation for the newly formed GCs that is steeper than the Galactic relation. However, the data are also well described by a scenario in which most red GCs are old, and few, if any, are formed in recent gaseous mergers. This is consistent with the old ages inferred from some spectroscopic studies of GCs in external systems. The event that induced the central galaxy starburst may have therefore involved insufficient gas mass for significant GC formation. We term such gas-poor events 'damp' mergers. This is the first paper of a series focused on investigating the star formation and evolutionary history of the two early-type galaxies NGC 1407 and NGC 1400. They are the two brightest galaxies of the NGC 1407 (or Eridanus-A) group, one of the 60 groups studied as part of the Group Evolution Multi-wavelength Study. Here, we present new high signal-to-noise ratio long-slit spectroscopic data obtained at the ESO 3.6-m telescope and high-resolution multiband imaging data from the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys and wide-field imaging from Subaru Suprime-Cam. We spatially resolved integrated spectra out to \u223c0.6 (NGC 1407) and \u223c1.3 (NGC 1400) effective radii. The radial profiles of the kinematic parameters vrot, \u03c3, h3 and h4 are measured. The surface brightness profiles are fitted to different galaxy light models and the colour distributions analysed. The multiband images are modelled to derive isophotal shape parameters and residual galaxy images. The parameters from the surface brightness profile fitting are used to estimate the mass of the possible central supermassive black hole in NGC 1407. The galaxies are found to be rotationally supported and to have a flat core in the surface brightness profiles. Elliptical isophotes are observed at all radii and no fine structures are detected in the residual galaxy images. From our results, we can also discard a possible interaction between NGC 1400, NGC 1407 and the group intergalactic medium. We estimate a mass of \u223c1.03 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 for the supermassive black hole in NGC 1407 galaxy. Long-slit spectra have been obtained with the Keck telescope for a sample of 11 early-type galaxies covering a wide range in luminosity and hence mass. Rotation velocity and velocity dispersions, together with 19 Lick line-strength gradients have been measured, to, on average, two effective radii. Stellar population models taking into account the effect of the non-solar chemical composition have been used to derive ages, metallicities and \u03b1/Fe abundances along the radius. We find that line-strength gradients are due mainly to variations of the total metallicity with the radius. One galaxy out of 11 shows very strong age gradients, with a young central component, while the age gradient for the rest of the sample is very shallow or consistent with zero. We also find small variations in the [\u03b1/Fe] ratio with radius. Contrary to what is expected in simple collapse models, galaxies show both positive and negative [\u03b1/Fe] profiles. This rules out a solely inside-out, or outside-in, formation mechanism for all early-type galaxies. We do not find a correlation between the metallicity and the [\u03b1/Fe] gradients, and the local metallicity is not correlated with the local velocity dispersion for all the galaxies of our sample, which rules out scenarios where the delay in the onset of the galactic winds is the only mechanism producing the metallicity gradients. We found that metallicity gradients are correlated with the shape of the isophotes and"

    "research_summary": "Supersymmetric localization and Ward identities have been used in the past several years to derive two integral constraints on the four-point function of the stress-tensor multiplet in $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory. These constraints are powerful tools for studying the theory, especially when used in tandem with analytic and/or numerical bootstrap techniques. In this paper, we consider three additional integral constraints that can be derived starting from the $\\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang-Mills theory placed on a squashed four-sphere. These constraints are technically much more challenging to derive than the ones in the literature, and much of the paper is devoted to developing techniques to make this computation tractable. Our end result is that these three constraints are implied by the two constraints already appearing in the literature. We consider M-theory on the backgrounds AdS$_4\\times S^7/\\mathbb{Z}_{N_f}$ and AdS$_7\\times S^4/\\mathbb{Z}_2$, which have fixed point locii AdS$_{d+1}\\times S^3$ for $d=3,6$. These theories are holographically dual to certain CFTs in $d=3,6$ with eight supercharges. We compute the bulk cubic couplings between graviton KK modes and gluon KK modes living on the fixed points of these theories, which are generically extremal. We use these couplings to compute the graviton exchange term that appears in the strong coupling expansion of holographic correlators of gluon KK modes $\\langle 22pp\\rangle$ in these theories, and check that it matches the expected flat space limit. We express the answer in terms of a new reduced correlator solution to the superconformal Ward identities, which we derive for all CFTs with eight supercharges in $3\\leq d\\leq6$. We study the $N=3$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in $3d$ coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N) \\times U(1)$ global symmetry. Recent evidence suggests the $N=2$ theory is not critical, which makes the $N=3$ theory the simplest possibility of deconfined quantum criticality. We apply the conformal bootstrap to correlators of charge $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators under the $U(1)$ symmetry, which gives us access also to $q=3,4$ operators. After imposing that only the lowest $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators are relevant, we find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by the large $N$ prediction for $q=1,2,3,4$ scalar monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were shown earlier to be accurate even for small $N$, as well as a lattice prediction for the $q=0$ non-monopole scalar operator. We also predict the scaling dimensions of the lowest spinning monopole operators, which we match to the large charge prediction for spinning operators. This suggests that the critical $CP^{2}$ model is described by this bootstrap bound."

    "research_summary": "ABSTRACT Radio interferometers targeting the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations at high redshift are subject to systematic effects that operate over a range of different time-scales. These can be isolated by designing appropriate Fourier filters that operate in fringe-rate (FR) space, the Fourier pair of local sidereal time. Applications of FR filtering include separating effects that are correlated with the rotating sky versus those relative to the ground, down-weighting emission in the primary beam sidelobes, and suppressing noise. FR filtering causes the noise contributions to the visibility data to become correlated in time, however, making interpretation of subsequent averaging and error estimation steps more subtle. In this paper, we describe fringe-rate filters that are implemented using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, and designed for two different purposes\u2013beam sidelobe/horizon suppression (the \u2018mainlobe\u2019 filter), and ground-locked systematics removal (the \u2018notch\u2019 filter). We apply these to simulated data, and study how their properties affect visibilities and power spectra generated from the simulations. Included is an introduction to fringe-rate filtering and a demonstration of fringe-rate filters applied to simple situations to aid understanding. Abstract Observations with radio arrays that target the 21-cm signal originating from the early Universe suffer from a variety of systematic effects. An important class of these are reflections and spurious couplings between antennas. We apply a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler to the modelling and mitigation of these systematics in simulated Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA) data. This method allows us to form statistical uncertainty estimates for both our models and the recovered visibilities, which is an important ingredient in establishing robust upper limits on the Epoch of Reionisation (EoR) power spectrum. In cases where the noise is large compared to the EoR signal, this approach can constrain the systematics well enough to mitigate them down to the noise level for both systematics studied. Incoherently averaging the recovered power spectra can further reduce the noise and improve recovery. Where the noise level is lower than the EoR, our modelling can mitigate the majority of the reflections and coupling with there being only a minor level of residual systematics. Our approach performs similarly to existing filtering/fitting techniques used in the HERA pipeline, but with the added benefit of rigorously propagating uncertainties. In all cases it does not significantly attenuate the underlying signal. Abstract The key to detecting neutral hydrogen during the epoch of reionization (EoR) is to separate the cosmological signal from the dominating foreground radiation. We developed direct optimal mapping (DOM) to map interferometric visibilities; it contains only linear operations, with full knowledge of point spread functions from visibilities to images. Here, we demonstrate a fast Fourier transform-based image power spectrum and its window functions computed from the DOM images. We use noiseless simulation, based on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Phase I configuration, to study the image power spectrum properties. The window functions show &lt;10 \u221211 of the integrated power leaks from the foreground-dominated region into the EoR window; the 2D and 1D power spectra also verify the separation between the foregrounds and the EoR. Abstract This paper presents the design and deployment of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) phase II system. HERA is designed as a staged experiment targeting 21 cm emission measurements of the Epoch of Reionization. First results from the phase I array are published as of early 2022, and deployment of the phase II system is nearing completion. We describe the design of the phase II system and discuss progress on commissioning and future upgrades. As HERA is a designated Square Kilometre Array pathfinder instrument, we also show a number of \u201ccase studies\u201d that investigate systematics seen while commissioning the phase II system, which may be of use in the design and operation of future arrays. Common pathologies are likely to manifest in similar ways across instruments, and many of these sources of contamination can be mitigated once the source is identified. Radio interferometers targeting the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations at high redshift are subject to systematic effects that operate over a range of different timescales. These can be isolated by designing appropriate Fourier filters that operate in fringe-rate (FR) space, the Fourier pair of local sidereal time (LST). Applications of FR filtering include separating effects that are correlated with the rotating sky vs. those relative to the ground, down-weighting emission in the primary beam sidelobes, and suppressing noise. FR filtering causes the noise contributions to the visibility data to become correlated in tim"

    "research_summary": "Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth's atmosphere and crust before reaching an underground detector. This Earth-shielding effect can induce a directional dependence in the dark matter flux, leading to a sidereal daily modulation in the signal rate. We perform a search for such a modulation using data from the SENSEI experiment, targeting MeV-scale dark matter. We achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity over previous direct-detection bounds for dark-matter masses below 1 MeV, assuming the Standard Halo Model with a Maxwell--Boltzmann velocity distribution, and constrain the amplitude of a general daily modulation signal to be below 6.8 electrons per gram per day. We present results from data acquired by the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB after a major upgrade in May 2023, which includes deploying 16 new sensors and replacing the copper trays that house the CCDs with a new light-tight design. We observe a single-electron event rate of $(1.39 \\pm 0.11) \\times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day, corresponding to $(39.8 \\pm 3.1)$ e$^-$/gram/day. This is an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the previous lowest single-electron rate in a silicon detector and the lowest for any photon detector in the near-infrared-ultraviolet range. We use these data to obtain a 90% confidence level upper bound of $1.53 \\times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day and to set constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that produce single-electron events. We hypothesize that the data taken at SNOLAB in the previous run, with an older tray design for the sensors, contained a larger rate of single-electron events due to light leaks. We test this hypothesis using data from the SENSEI detector located in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab."

Abstract Stars primarily form in galactic spiral arms within dense, filamentary molecular clouds. The largest and most elongated of these molecular clouds are referred to as \u201cbones,\u201d which are massive, velocity-coherent filaments (lengths \u223c20 to &gt;100 pc, widths \u223c1\u20132 pc) that run approximately parallel and in close proximity to the Galactic plane. While these bones have been generally well characterized, the importance and structure of their magnetic fields (B-fields) remain largely unconstrained. Through the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy Legacy program FIlaments Extremely Long and Dark: a Magnetic Polarization Survey (FIELDMAPS), we mapped the B-fields of 10 bones in the Milky Way. We found that their B-fields are varied, with no single preferred alignment along the entire spine of the bones. At higher column densities, the spines of the bones are more likely to align perpendicularly to the B-fields, although this is not ubiquitous, and the alignment shows no strong correlation with the locations of identified young stellar objects. We estimated the B-field strengths across the bones and found them to be \u223c30\u2013150 \u03bc G at parsec scales. Despite the generally low virial parameters, the B-fields are strong compared to the local gravity, suggesting that B-fields play a significant role in resisting global collapse. Moreover, the B-fields may"

    "research_summary": "Context.Swift J1910.2\u20130546 (=MAXI J1910\u2212057) is a Galactic X-ray transient discovered during a bright outburst in 2012. Its X-ray spectral and timing properties point to a black-hole accretor, yet the orbital period remains uncertain, and no reliable dynamical constraints on the binary parameters are available. The 2012 event, extensively monitored at X-ray and optical wavelengths, offers a rare opportunity to investigate the structure and dynamics of the system and to constrain its fundamental properties. Aims. We use time-series optical photometry and spectroscopy, obtained during outburst and quiescence, to estimate the orbital period, characterise the donor star, determine the interstellar extinction, distance, and system geometry, and constrain the component masses. Methods. Multi-site r -band and clear-filter light curves and WHT/ACAM spectra from the 2012 outburst were combined with time-series spectroscopy from GTC/OSIRIS and VLT/FORS2 in quiescence. Period searches were conducted using generalised Lomb\u2013Scargle, phase-dispersion minimisation, and analysis-of-variance algorithms. We used diffuse interstellar bands to constrain E ( B \u2212 V ), while empirical correlations involving H \u03b1 yielded estimates of K 2 , q , and i . Results. We detected a coherent, double-humped modulation with a period of 0.0941 \u00b1 0.0007 d (2.26 \u00b1 0.02 h) during the outburst. Its morphology is consistent with an early superhump, suggesting that the true orbital period may be slightly shorter than 4.52 h. The H \u03b1 radial velocity curves do not yield a definitive orbital period. In quiescence, TiO bands indicate an M3\u2212M3.5 donor contributing \u224370% of the red continuum. Diffuse interstellar bands give E ( B \u2212 V ) = 0.60 \u00b1 0.05 and N H = (3.9 \u00b1 1.3)\u00d710 21 cm \u22122 , placing the system at a distance of 2.8\u22124.0 kpc. The H \u03b1 line width in quiescence (FWHM 0 = 990 \u00b1 45 km s \u22121 ), via a FWHM\u2013 K 2 calibration, provides an estimate of K 2 , while its double-peaked profile gives q and the orbital inclination. The latter appears much higher than estimates from X-ray studies. Adopting the resulting K 2 = 230 \u00b1 17 km s \u22121 and q = 0.032 \u00b1 0.010, along with two orbital period scenarios (2.25 and 4.50 h), Monte Carlo sampling returns a compact object mass of M 1 = 8 \u2212 11 M \u2299 and an inclination of i = 13\u00b0 \u221218\u00b0 for plausible donor masses ( M 2 = 0.25 \u2212 0.35 M \u2299 ). Overall, we favour an orbital period of 4.5 h. Conclusions.Swift J1910.2\u20130546 may be a short-period, low-inclination black hole X-ray transient, although the possibility of it being a neutron star accretor cannot be completely ruled out. Subsequent phase-resolved spectroscopy and photometry during quiescence are needed to better determine its fundamental parameters. Resumen: En el \u00e1mbito geogr\u00e1fico que nos ocupa, entornos de la Laguna de la Janda y Campo de Gibraltar, existen unos trescientos abrigos con arte rupestre escasamente estudiados.En veintid\u00f3s de ellos est\u00e1 representada la figura soliforme en sus paredes rocosas.La denominada Cueva del Sol es uno de los abrigos que forman parte de este conjunto.Sus especiales caracter\u00edsticas, tanto geogr\u00e1ficas como iconogr\u00e1ficas, y los reveladores resultados de observaciones astron\u00f3micas apuntan a la existencia de un marcador solar del solsticio de invierno, y convierten a esta cavidad en una de las m\u00e1s excepcionales del conjunto y, tal vez, de la pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica.Los datos obtenidos hacen que este abrigo pueda llevarnos a determinar algunos aspectos concretos sobre los cultos asociados al comportamiento solar y su funci\u00f3n como regulador de las actividades productivas y, por ende, acercarnos a la cosmovisi\u00f3n de los hacedores de estas pinturas.Para ello es condici\u00f3n sine qua non un an\u00e1lisis individual y profundo, realizado a partir de un enfoque te\u00f3rico-metodol\u00f3gico basado sobre todo Aims. During the last ~50 years, the population of black hole candidates in X-ray binaries has increased considerably, with 59 Galactic objects being detected in transient low-mass X-ray binaries, as well as a few in persistent systems (including ~5 extragalactic binaries). Methods. We collect near-infrared, optical, and X-ray information spread over hundreds of references to study the population of black holes in X-ray transients as a whole. Results. We present the most updated catalogue of black hole transients. This contains X-ray, optical, and near-infrared observations, together with their astrometric and dynamical properties. The catalogue provides new and useful information in both statistical and observational parameters and provides a thorough and complete overview of the black hole population in the Milky Way. Analysing the distances and spatial distribution of the observed systems, we estimate a total population of ~1300 Galactic black hole transients. This means that we have only discovered less than ~5% of the total Galactic distribution. We present the first dynamical determination of the binary parameters of an eclipsing SW Sextantis star in the 3\u20134 h orbi"

    "research_summary": "A single mechanism, endemic to the standard model of physics, is proposed to explain wavefunction collapse, classical motion, dissipation, equilibration, and the transition from pure quantum mechanics through open system decoherence to the natural regime. Spontaneous events in the neighborhood of a particle disrupts correlation such that large many-particle states do not persist and each particle collapses to a stable mode of motion established by its neighbors. These events are the source of thermal fluctuation and drive diffusion. Consequently, evolution is not deterministic, unitary or classically conservative; diffusion toward a steady state occurs incessantly in every system of particles, though slowed under unnatural experimental conditions that suppress these events. Mean properties of a system evolve as particles jump between single-particle modes, producing observed transport laws and equilibrium properties without additional postulate or empirical factors. These modes are localized in dense material, yielding classical characteristics. Boltzmann's equal probability postulate is valid only when comparing results of nonrelativistic observers. The foundation of standard thermodynamics is the postulate of the Second Law, that entropy of an isolated system is maximum in equilibrium. Direct computation of balanced diffusive flows by a novel method based on quantum mode transition theory reveals that entropy is not maximum when particles can transform through phase transitions and chemical reactions. The Second Law is therefore not generally valid and standard theory cannot determine the state of systems with transforming particles. This new \"modal thermodynamics\" theory is comprehensive, and agrees with known empirical laws of nature, without entropy or postulate. The Second Law of thermodynamics requires positive internal entropy production (IEP) when a system evolves from one state to the next. IEP supposedly indicates why an isolated system equilibrates and is steady thereafter, and that a process is irreversible between two equilibrium states. Clausius originally postulated the entropy law based on his First Law of thermodynamics, which represents internal energy conservation. However, total energy conservation not only clarifies all sources of entropy but also reveals that negative IEP occurs, violating the Second Law. Entropy does not generally indicate spontaneous (irreversible) processes between equilibrium states. Practical analysis of complex systems currently relies on empirical transport laws because diffusion cannot be described by state functions alone, as assumed in Classical Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics. Lagrange mechanics emerge when diffusion is negligible; diffusion does not emerge in many-body Lagrange theory. I derive comprehensive transport equations directly from quantum mechanical principles by tallying particle motion individually, providing a concrete, seamless foundation for all applied physical science. This new approach resolves, without entropy or axiom, several critical issues that originally inspired the standard theories, and clarifies analysis of processes in mesoscopic and macroscopic systems. We report on measurements of forces acting between two conducting surfaces in\\na spherical-plane configuration in the 35 nm-1 micrometer separation range. The\\nmeasurements are obtained by performing electrostatic calibrations followed by\\na residual analysis after subtracting the electrostatic-dependent component. We\\nfind in all runs optimal fitting of the calibrations for exponents smaller than\\nthe one predicted by electrostatics for an ideal sphere-plane geometry. We also\\nfind that the external bias potential necessary to minimize the electrostatic\\ncontribution depends on the sphere-plane distance. In spite of these anomalies,\\nby implementing a parametrixation-dependent subtraction of the electrostatic\\ncontribution we have found evidence for short-distance attractive forces of\\nmagnitude comparable to the expected Casimir-Lifshitz force. We finally discuss\\nthe relevance of our findings in the more general context of Casimir-Lifshitz\\nforce measurements, with particular regard to the critical issues of the\\nelectrical and geometrical characterization of the involved surfaces.\\n"

    "research_summary": "Abstract We discuss fluxes of long-lived supersymmetric (SUSY) particles produced in the atmosphere from ultra-high energy cosmic-ray interactions with air nuclei. We consider long-lived particle production which proceeds first via the on-shell formation of heavier particles in the SUSY spectrum and then their decays. Specifically, we focus on the production of stau pairs from the decays of squarks produced in the initial cosmic ray-air collision under the purview of gauge-mediated symmetry breaking models that have the stau as the next-to-lightest SUSY particle. The calculation of the resulting stau flux schematically mirrors that of prompt atmospheric neutrino production, however, with the energy scale of initial hadronic collision set to EeV energy scales of the incident cosmic rays rather than the PeV energies where the prompt atmospheric neutrino fluxes dominate over neutrino fluxes from pions and kaons, and with the appropriate stau production cross section. We show the effect of accounting for the energy distribution of the staus relative to the squark energy distributions. We discuss the potential for future ultra-high energy detectors similar in scope to IceCube-Gen 2 to detect atmospheric staus via tracks going through the detector volume. Current collider constraints on stau pair production within the SUSY framework considered here are more constraining than those from a detector like IceCube-Gen 2 over ten years.

Gravitational microlensing is a phenomenon that allows us to observe the dark remnants of stellar evolution, even if these bodies are no longer emitting electromagnetic radiation. In particular, it can be useful to observe solitary neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes, providing a unique window through which to understand stellar evolution. Obtaining direct mass measurements with this technique requires precise observations of both the change in brightness and the position of the microlensed star. The European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia satellite can provide both. Using publicly available data from different surveys, we analysed events published in the Gaia Data Release 3 ( Gaia DR3) microlensing catalogue. Here, we describe our selection of candidate dark lenses, where we suspect the lens is a white dwarf (WD), a neutron star (NS), a black hole (BH), or a mass-gap object, with a mass in the range between the heaviest NS and the least massive BH. We estimated the mass of the lenses using information obtained from the best-fitting microlensing models, source star, Galactic model, and the expected parameter distributions. We found eleven candidates for dark remnants: one WDs, three NSs, three mass-gap objects, and four BHs."

    "research_summary": "We investigate the possible collider signatures of a new Higgs in simple extensions of the Standard Model where baryon number is a local symmetry spontaneously broken at the low scale. Here, we refer to this new Higgs as \u201cBaryonic Higgs\u201d. This Higgs has peculiar properties since it can decay into all Standard Model particles, the leptophobic gauge boson, and the vector-like quarks present in these theories to ensure anomaly cancellation. We investigate in detail the constraints from the \u03b3\u03b3, Z\u03b3, ZZ, and W W searches at the Large Hadron Collider, needed to find a lower bound on the scale at which baryon number is spontaneously broken. The di-photon channel turns out to be a very sensitive probe in the case of small scalar mixing and can severely constrain the baryonic scale. Finally, we also study the properties of the leptophobic gauge boson in order to understand the testability of these theories at the LHC. These are the proceedings of the LHCSki 2016 workshop \"A First Discussion of 13 TeV Results\" that has been held at the Obergurgl Universit\u00e4tszentrum, Tirol, Austria, April 10 - 15, 2016. In this workshop the consequences of the most recent results from the LHC have been discussed, with a focus also on the interplay with dark matter physics, flavor physics, and precision measurements. Contributions from the workshop speakers have been compiled into this document. We revisit the simplest model for dark matter. In this context the dark matter candidate is a real scalar field which interacts with the Standard Model particles through the Higgs portal. We discuss the relic density constraints as well as the predictions for direct and indirect detection. The final state radiation processes are investigated in order to understand the visibility of the gamma lines from dark matter annihilation. We find two regions where one could observe the gamma lines at gamma-ray telescopes. We point out that the region where the dark matter mass is between 92 and 300 GeV can be tested in the near future at direct and indirect detection experiments."

    "research_summary": "Nulling interferometry is one of the direct detection methods assessed to find and characterize extrasolar planets and particularly telluric ones. Several projects such as Darwin [1;2], TPF-I [3;4], PEGASE [5;6] or FKSI [7], are currently considered. One of the main issues is the feasibility of a stable polychromatic null despite the presence of significant disturbances, induced by vibrations, atmospheric turbulence on the ground or satellite drift. Satisfying all these requirements is a great challenge and a key issue of these missions. In the context of the PEGASE mission, it was decided (in 2006), to build a laboratory demonstrator named PERSEE. It is the first laboratory setup which couples deep nulling interferometry with a free flying GNC simulator [8]. It is developed by a consortium composed of CNES, IAS, LESIA, OCA, ONERA, and TAS. In this paper, we detail the main objectives, the set-up and the function of the bench. We describe all the subsystems and we focus particularly on two key points of PERSEE: the beam combiner and the Fringe tracker. \\n ATLAS is the future Laser Tomographic AO system of the E-ELT. Its goal is to provide a\\n diffraction limited PSF in K band for a significant part of the sky (typically more than 60%).\\n A first concept of the module combined with optomechanical implementation and associated\\n performance is presented. Results show the feasibility of the concept, its versatility and a\\n relative simplicity which is a good first step toward a potential implementation in the early\\n time of the telescope.\\n \\n To achieve the ultimate resolution of future ELTs, the segments of their primary mirror must\\n be aligned. This paper present focal plane (FP) wavefront sensing techniques that allow to\\n perform piston measurements between the segments. Those techniques have the advantage of using\\n images that are the result of the interference of all the segments. This makes FP measurements\\n capable of handling complex apertures. New developments at ONERA allow us to apply FP\\n measurements for different applications. We present an upgrade of the usual Shack-Hartmann\\n pairwise technique. We also show that phase diversity is able to cophase an ELT. Eventually, we\\n show our current developments in term of analytical algorithms and our new bench, NIRTA, which\\n is under integration at ONERA.\\n International audience International audience"

In particular, this is the case when defining SPARQL extension functions, and the ability to capitalize complex SPARQL filter expressions into extension functions or to define and reuse dedicated aggregates would support modularity and maintenance of the code.Another use case is the definition of functional properties associated to RDF resources and the definition of procedural attachments as functions assigned to RDFS or OWL classes with the selection of the function to be applied to a resource depending on the type of the resource. To address these needs we define a Linked Data Script language on top of the SPARQL filter expression language. We provide the syntax and the semantics of the LDScript language."

    "research_summary": "The collective monograph summarises almost twenty years of experience of the Thermal Energy Technologyes Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in theoretical and practical research on the joint thermal processing of two solid fuels. The research has been applied in boiler furnaces of various capacities, using various technologies, from pulverised coal combustion to bed combustion. The research is unique due to the wide range of fuels involved \u2014 coal of all grades and different countries of origin, biomass, petroleum coke, coal preparation waste, etc. Such research has contributed to expanding the energy sector\u2019s fuel base with local fuels, industrial and agricultural waste, reducing harmful emissions, creating distributed generation, and thus, to Ukraine\u2019s energy independence. Humic substances (HS) belong to a fairly common class of organic compounds in nature, which are a component of soils, peat, lignite and sapropels. Some properties of humates (salts of humic acids) make it possible to use them in various fields \u2013 crop production, animal production, well drilling and soil structuring. The biological and chemical activity of humic substances is well known. It is caused by the presence of such functional groups as carboxyl, hydroxyl, carbonyl, nitrogen- and sulfur-containing in the composition of GR macromolecules. This fact also serves as a basis for a more extensive study of other properties of GR, namely antioxidant activity. Purpose. Deepening and expanding the understanding of the biological and antioxidant activity of lignite humic (HA) and hymatomelanic (HmA) acids, determining its nature and evaluating the prospects of its use in little-studied processes of oxidation of organic and consumer substances. Methodology. The paper used a photocolorimetric method for determining the antiradical activity (ARA) of two components of humic substances of domestic lignite - humic and hymatomelanic acids. The antioxidant activity (AOA) of humic and hymatomelanic acids from lignite was determined using the gas volumetric method, evaluating the rate of reaction inhibition using the example of the initiated liquid-phase oxidation of cumene with oxygen. Findings. It was established that humic acids exhibit more pronounced antioxidant properties in the processes of radical-chain oxidation of hydrocarbons compared to hymatomelanic acids. The total AOA of HA is 1.68 relative units, which is almost three times higher than this figure for HmA (0.50). On the other hand, it has been experimentally proven that hymatomelanic acids have more pronounced antiradical properties than humic acids. ARA HmA is 0.90 relative units, which is approximately three times more than the similar value for HA (0.57). Originality. Despite the fact that a number of methods for determining the antiradical and antioxidant activity of low-molecular antioxidants and their mixtures have been developed, a method for determining these indicators for high-molecular native compounds has not yet been created. For the first time, a method for determining the antiradical effect of humic substances using the stable 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) was proposed and experimentally tested. A method for determining the antioxidant activity of humic and hymatomelanic acids in hydrocarbon oxidation processes (on the example of cumulus) has been developed. The convenience and satisfactory reproducibility of the developed methods are shown. Practical value. The green-chemistry related development and application of drugs based on native and modified humic substances as polymers with adjustable redox properties (redox polymers) is a relevant direction of sustainable development of society. These substances are the basis for obtaining new medicines, plant protection products, new sorbents, preparations for the reclamation of territories contaminated with radionuclides, heavy metals, organic ecotoxicants, oil products, etc. The modern mechanisms of corrosion processes during the burning of carbon raw materials (biomass waste, coal of various metamorphisms) with a high content (Na2O in ash \u22652%) of low-melting salts and sulfur are considered. The morphological features of deposits on the surface of the metal exposed to the high-temperature combustion gases of the salty coal (SC) before and after desalination and also composition of corrosion pro\u00adducts of ferrite steel during SC ashing and its mixture with power-generating gas coal are determined. It is experimentally shown that extraction of water-soluble compounds from SC (on the example of deposits of Northern Donbass) and its mixture with coal of low salinity lead to a significant reduction in corrosion of heating surfaces during burning."

    "research_summary": "Novel polymeric film composites based on azo-containing methacrylic copolymer doped with new organometallic Pd(II) complexes of different structure and molecular content of \u201cheavy\u201d Pd atoms have been prepared. Their spectral and photoelectrophysical properties have been investigated. It was found that the obtained film composites exhibit photoconductivity and photovoltaic effect in the absorption spectral region of the respective azo chromophores. The features of the internal photoeffect, as well as the nature of the photovoltaic effect in the created photoconductive polymer composites have been analyzed. The increase in photoconductivity and photovoltaic response value in series azo polymer matrix \u2192 azo polymer composites doped with Pd complex was explained in terms of the influence of electron acceptor complex ligands and heavy Pd atom effect on the non-equilibrium charge carriers photogeneration and transport processes in the obtained composites. A method for the synthesis of protic polymeric ionic liquid (PIL) of a block oligomeric structure with ionic bonds in the main chain, which turns into a liquid state at temperatures below 50 \u00b0C, was developed. Ionic bonding was used to form a polymer chain. It was formed as a result of neutralization reaction between oligomers of telechelic structure with terminal acidic and basic groups. A new linear oligomer containing basic tertiary nitrogen atoms at the ends of the oligoether chain (PEO-2NEt2) was obtained by reaction of \u03b1,\u03c9-diglycidyl ether of polyethylene glycol MW 1000 with N,N-diethylamine. A linear oligomer with terminal sulfonic acid groups (PEO-2SO3H), which is a product of the interaction of polyethylene glycol (MW 1000) with the cyclic anhydride of 2-sulfobenzoic acid, was used as an acidic linear oligomer. The synthesis of PIL [PEO-2H-2NEt2]2+ [PEO-2SO3]2- was carried out by neutralization of basic oligomer PEO-2NEt2 with the acidic oligomer PEO-2SO3H in their molar ratio of 1:1. The structure of the obtained compound was characterized by the methods of FTIR and 1H NMR spectroscopy. According to the DSC data, the synthesized PIL contains an amorphous phase with a glass transition temperature of -49.7 \u00b0\u0421 and a crystalline phase with a melting temperature of 34.5 \u00b0\u0421. The decomposition onset temperature corresponding to 5% weight loss is 271 \u00b0C according to the TGA. The ionic conductivity of PIL studied by dielectric relaxation spectroscopy under anhydrous conditions in the range from 40 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C increases with increase in temperature and reaches 2.7\u00b710-4 S/cm. The resulting compound is promising as a proton-conducting medium for various electrochemical devices."

    "research_summary": "It was found that the in-situ reaction of halogen-containing imidazolium and benzimidazolium salts with silver nitrate, chloride, iodide or perchlorate in the presence of potassium carbonate leads to the corresponding monocarbene (NHC) (LAgX) and bis-NHC silver complexes (L2AgX) including the first strongly sterically shielded bis-NHC complexes (IPr)2AgX. In the presence of o-phenanthroline, carbene-phenanthroline complex (IPr\u2217)(phen)AgClO4 was obtained. The reactions can be an addition to the known method of Lin with the use of silver oxide. The halogenide silver carbene complexes are also obtained by the exchange of the anion from the ionic perchlorate complexes to halogenide ions (Cl\u2212, I\u2212). The structure of the synthesized compounds is confirmed by the methods of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and for five compounds by the X-ray diffraction study. Most compounds have an ionic character in crystals and in solutions, even for the complex with a sterically shielded silver atom (IPr)2AgNO3 and monocarbene complexes. Synthesized complexes show high antibacterial (MIC up to 1.9 \u03bcg/mL on M. luteum) and antifungal activity (MIC up to 0.9 \u03bcg/mL on A. niger and 1.9 \u03bcg/mL on C. tenuis). Abstract It was found that the reaction of halogen\u2010containing and other imidazolium and benzimidazolium salts (LHX) with copper(I) iodide in the presence of potassium carbonate at room temperature leads to mono\u2010 (LCuI) and biscarbene complexes of copper(I) iodide (L 2 CuI), and in the presence of o \u2010phenanthroline to a new type of carbene\u2013phenanthroline complexes of copper(I) iodide L(phen)CuI. The structure of the synthesized compounds is confirmed by the methods of 1 H and 13 C\u2010NMR spectroscopy and for five compounds by the X\u2010ray diffraction study. Unlike the known complex [IPr(phen)Cu] + I \u2010 , which is ionic, all the synthesized carbene\u2013phenanthroline complexes have a polarized covalent character in the crystals, even for the complex with a sterically shielded copper atom IPr*(phen)CuI. The structure of a close ion pair L 2 Cu + I \u2010 was proved for one biscarbene complex. Synthesized complexes show high antibacterial activity. \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0442\u044e \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0432\u044f\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043f\u0430\u043c\u2019\u044f\u0442\u0456 \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0432 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0437\u0456 \u0444\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0445\u0456\u043c\u0456\u0457, \u043a\u0456\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0456\u0437\u0443, \u0442\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u0440\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0437\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438, \u043b\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0414\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0432 \u0433\u0430\u043b\u0443\u0437\u0456 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0438 \u0456 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u0456\u043a\u0438 (1993, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e), \u043b\u0430\u0443\u0440\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u0456\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0456 \u041b.\u0412. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (1969), \u0434\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0406\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 \u0456 \u0433\u0435\u043e\u0445\u0456\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (1982\u20141986), \u043a\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0432\u043d\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0412\u0456\u0434\u0434\u0456\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0444\u0456\u0437\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0445\u0456\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u0456 \u0442\u0435\u0445\u043d\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0456\u0457 \u0433\u043e\u0440\u044e\u0447\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043f\u0430\u043b\u0438\u043d \u0406\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0442\u0443 \u0444\u0456\u0437\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0457 \u0445\u0456\u043c\u0456\u0457 \u0456\u043c. \u041b.\u0412. \u041f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0436\u0435\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (1986\u20141991), \u0434\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0430 \u0445\u0456\u043c\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0445 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u043a (1964), \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u043e\u0440\u0430 (1966), \u0434\u0456\u0439\u0441\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430 \u041d\u0422\u0428 (1992, \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0442\u043d\u043e), \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 (1973) \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430. \u042f\u043a \u0446\u0438\u0442\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0442\u0438: \u041e\u043f\u0435\u0439\u0434\u0430 \u0419.\u041e., \u0420\u0430\u0454\u043d\u043a\u043e \u0413.\u0424., \u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432 \u0410.\u0424. \u0428\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430 \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430 \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430: \u0434\u043e\u0441\u044f\u0433\u043d\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0432 \u043d\u0430\u0443\u0446\u0456 \u0442\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0446\u0456 (\u0434\u043e 100-\u0440\u0456\u0447\u0447\u044f \u0430\u043a\u0430\u0434\u0435\u043c\u0456\u043a\u0430 \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438 \u0420.\u0412. \u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0430). \u0412\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u041d\u0410\u041d \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438. 2025. \u2116 3. \u0421. 90\u201499. https://doi.org/10.15407/visn2025.03.090"

    "research_summary": "\u2022 Cu 0,5 Zn 0,5 Fe 2 O 4 ferrite samples are synthesized by co-precipitation method. \u2022 Heat treated ferrites prepared with polyvinylpyrrolidone are reduced in an electrochemical system. \u2022 Fe-Cu composites form after the electrochemical reduction of the ferrites. \u2022 The Fe-Cu composite formation is influenced by heat treatment and polyvinylpyrrolidone polymer. \u2022 Fe-Cu composite powders exhibit a high electrocatalytic activity. Fe-Cu composites were synthesized from Cu 0,5 Zn 0,5 Fe 2 O 4 ferrite samples prepared using a co-precipitation method without and with a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) followed by heat treatment and electrochemical reduction. The phase constitutions and morphological features of the produced Cu-Zn ferrites and Fe-Cu composites were analyzed. The thermal stability of Cu-Zn-ferrites in the temperature range of 500-900\u00b0C and the effect of the annealing temperature and PVP polymer on the electrochemical reduction were established. The resulting Fe-Cu composites were used as catalysts in the electrohydrogenation of p -nitroaniline. The Fe-Cu composites formed from Cu 0,5 Zn 0,5 Fe 2 O 4 + PVP samples exhibited good electrocatalytic activity in this process, increasing the p -nitroaniline hydrogenation rate to 8,2-8,3 mL H 2 /min compared with 6,6 mL H 2 /min in its electrochemical reduction. The p -nitroaniline conversion increased to 99-100% with the selective formation of p -phenylenediamine. Bimetallic Fe-Ag composites were fabricated based on silver (I) ferrite (AgFeO2) synthesized using a co-precipitation method with and without the polyvinyl alcohol as a nanoparticle stabilizer, followed by the heat treatment at 500, 700 and 900\u00b0C and electrochemical reduction. Phase compositions and morphological features of AgFeO2 samples produced after heat treatment and after electrochemical experiments were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy. A decrease in the temperature of the thermal decomposition of silver ferrite prepared with polyvinyl alcohol was established. The possibility of the electrochemical reduction of AgFeO2 in aqueous alkaline catholyte on a copper cathode with the formation of crystalline phases of both metals or their alloy was shown. The Fe-Ag composites formed during heat treatment and electrochemical reduction were used as electrocatalysts in the electrohydrogenation of p- and o-isomers of nitrobenzoic acid and exhibited high activity. Compared to their electrochemical reduction under similar conditions, the hydrogenation rate and hydrogen utilization coefficient were increased, and their conversion reached the maximum values. The main products of electrocatalytic hydrogenation are p- and o-isomers of aminobenzoic acid, which are widely used in the production of drugs (for example, benzocaine, novocaine., etc.)."

The main products of electrocatalytic hydrogenation are p- and o-isomers of aminobenzoic acid, which are widely used in the production of drugs (for example, benzocaine, novocaine., etc.). Ultrafine copper and nickel powders are synthesized by a chemical reduction of the metal cations from their salts in an aqueous ethanol solution without and with the addition of a polymer stabilizer (polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyvinyl alcohol). The structure and morphological features of the prepared metal powders were investigated by X-ray phase analysis and electron microscopy. The electrocatalytic properties of the Cu and Ni powders have been studied in the electrohydrogenation of acetophenone, nitrobenzene, p-nitroaniline, and cyclohexanone. A higher electrocatalytic activity of Cu powders, as well as skeletal copper, was established in the electrohydrogenation of the first three of the listed compounds in comparison with nickel powders, which is explained by the ability of copper cations to be reduced from its oxides in the electrochemical system under investigation. It is shown that the use of polymer stabilizers in the synthesis of Cu and Ni powders contributes to reducing metal particle sizes, but does not increase the electrocatalytic activity of the corresponding metal powders."

    "research_summary": "The use of peptide preparations is one of the current trends in modern agriculture. These preparations can be used at the stage of seed germination, which is an effective strategy for increasing the dynamics of growth and successful development of plants. The article presents the results of laboratory experiments aimed at studying the effect of a complex of short peptides AC-5 (aspartic acid, glutamic acid, arginine) on the germination of spring barley seeds (Hordeum vulgare L.) - Vladimir variety and the intensity of their germination. The maximum values of germination energy (95%, 71% at the control) and seed germination (99%, 82% at the control) were obtained in variants with seed treatment with a complex of short peptides at concentrations of 1*10-12 and 1*10-13 g/l, the minimum \u2013 in variants with seed treatment at concentrations of 1*10-8 g/l. To determine the effective concentration of short peptides that cause the greatest growth-stimulating effect, morphometric characteristics of barley seedlings (length of roots and sprouts, yield of raw biomass, dry mass of sprouts and dry mass of roots) were studied. According to the totality of the maximum values, the optimal concentration of a complex of short peptides for pre\u2013sowing treatment of spring barley seeds of the Vladimir variety is 1*10-13 g/l. Keywords: SPRING BARLEY, A COMPLEX OF SHORT PEPTIDES, SEED GERMINATION, GERMINATION ENERGY, LABORATORY EXPERIENCE By gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry has been investigated the composition of essential oils and the change in the ontogenesis and exogenous effects on the plant Mentha piperita L. drugs retardant type. With the introduction of oil crops from the southern regions to the more northern regions of the component composition of the essential oil practically does not change. There are only minor variations in the content of some terpenoids oils. Exogenous preharvest treatment plant growth regulators can in some cases deliberately influence the activity of various terpenoid biosynthesis and increase the content of the most valuable components of the essential oil.Content and composition of EM is largely determined by factors such as age and leaves of plants, as well as different climatic cal, soil and agronomic conditions. Processing plants different phytoregulators also affects the content and composition of oil. Biosynthesis of terpenoids polyenzyme performed in centers, the activity and the nature of which is determined primarily genetic characteristics of plants, in addition, the activity of certain enzymes of these centers is under the control of hormonal balance and changes in ontogeny, as well as under the influence of exogenous factors.It is shown that the formation of the maximum bioefficiency in ontogeny of aromatic plants, it is advisable to use a two-stage technology to grow them. Plants producing terpenoids of essential oils, the initial step is to create the conditions for the formation of the maximum yield of aboveground mass of plants, including the use of synthetic plant growth regulators. In the second stage &amp;quot;biosynthetic&amp;quot; upon the occurrence of the reproductive phase before harvesting plants, we recommend that inhibit the growth of phytoregulators retardant type. In this case, we observe stimulation accumulation in aboveground mass of secondary metabolites. Inhibition of growth in the preharvest period, aromatic plants determines the strategy of production process management and the formation of bio-productivity as an integral function of productivity and high levels of concentration in the feed terpenoids.Exogenous preharvest treatment plant growth regulators allows purposefully influence the activity of the biosynthesis of various terpenoids, increasing the most valuable components of essential oils."

    "research_summary": "AI systems that \"think\" in human language offer a unique opportunity for AI safety: we can monitor their chains of thought (CoT) for the intent to misbehave. Like all other known AI oversight methods, CoT monitoring is imperfect and allows some misbehavior to go unnoticed. Nevertheless, it shows promise and we recommend further research into CoT monitorability and investment in CoT monitoring alongside existing safety methods. Because CoT monitorability may be fragile, we recommend that frontier model developers consider the impact of development decisions on CoT monitorability. We conduct experiments on the impact of increasing inference-time compute in reasoning models (specifically OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini) on their robustness to adversarial attacks. We find that across a variety of attacks, increased inference-time compute leads to improved robustness. In many cases (with important exceptions), the fraction of model samples where the attack succeeds tends to zero as the amount of test-time compute grows. We perform no adversarial training for the tasks we study, and we increase inference-time compute by simply allowing the models to spend more compute on reasoning, independently of the form of attack. Our results suggest that inference-time compute has the potential to improve adversarial robustness for Large Language Models. We also explore new attacks directed at reasoning models, as well as settings where inference-time compute does not improve reliability, and speculate on the reasons for these as well as ways to address them. We introduce Codex, a GPT language model fine-tuned on publicly available code from GitHub, and study its Python code-writing capabilities. A distinct production version of Codex powers GitHub Copilot. On HumanEval, a new evaluation set we release to measure functional correctness for synthesizing programs from docstrings, our model solves 28.8% of the problems, while GPT-3 solves 0% and GPT-J solves 11.4%. Furthermore, we find that repeated sampling from the model is a surprisingly effective strategy for producing working solutions to difficult prompts. Using this method, we solve 70.2% of our problems with 100 samples per problem. Careful investigation of our model reveals its limitations, including difficulty with docstrings describing long chains of operations and with binding operations to variables. Finally, we discuss the potential broader impacts of deploying powerful code generation technologies, covering safety, security, and economics. A core issue with learning to optimize neural networks has been the lack of generalization to real world problems. To address this, we describe a system designed from a generalization-first perspective, learning to update optimizer hyperparameters instead of model parameters directly using novel features, actions, and a reward function. This system outperforms Adam at all neural network tasks including on modalities not seen during training. We achieve 2x speedups on ImageNet, and a 2.5x speedup on a language modeling task using over 5 orders of magnitude more compute than the training tasks. We train a single, goal-conditioned policy that can solve many robotic manipulation tasks, including tasks with previously unseen goals and objects. We rely on asymmetric self-play for goal discovery, where two agents, Alice and Bob, play a game. Alice is asked to propose challenging goals and Bob aims to solve them. We show that this method can discover highly diverse and complex goals without any human priors. Bob can be trained with only sparse rewards, because the interaction between Alice and Bob results in a natural curriculum and Bob can learn from Alice's trajectory when relabeled as a goal-conditioned demonstration. Finally, our method scales, resulting in a single policy that can generalize to many unseen tasks such as setting a table, stacking blocks, and solving simple puzzles. Videos of a learned policy is available at https://robotics-self-play.github.io."

    "research_summary": "Terahertz (THz) spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs) can play a key role in ultrasensitive fingerprint sensing of trace substances by the enhanced confinement of the electric field that they provide. However, achieving both high sensitivity and broadband detection simultaneously in such structures remains a significant challenge owing to the necessary trade-off between field confinement and bandwidth. This study demonstrates a sensing chip based on an artificial THz SSPP slow-light waveguide that simultaneously achieves broad bandwidth (up to 1 THz) along with highly sensitive detection achieved by enhancing both field confinement strength and the effective light-matter interaction distance. We use \u03b1-lactose monohydrate as a model analyte and show that our SSPP-integrated THz sensing chip detects its characteristic rotational mode at 0.53 THz at concentrations as low as 18 \u03bcg/\u03bcL, which represents a 4-fold improvement in the detection limit over previous sensors. Repeat measurements show reliable stability and reproducibility for the chip. In operating up to 1 THz, a frequency range of significant interest for the study of quantum excitations in condensed matter systems as well as for terahertz studies of molecular dynamics in polycrystalline materials, our scalable platform is ideal for the study of light-matter interactions in a wide range of advanced material systems. This paper discusses the application of on-chip terahertz (THz) filters attached to waveguides that can act as sensor elements, including for scanned imaging applications. Our work presents a comparative numerical study of several different geometries (comprising five split-ring resonator geometries and a quarter-wavelength stub resonator, the latter being well established as a sensor at THz frequencies and therefore able to act as a benchmark). We designed each structure to have a resonant frequency of 500 GHz, allowing the impact of resonator geometry on sensing performance to be isolated; the performance was quantified by assessing each design using four figures of merit: resonance quality factor, sensitivity (relative frequency shift under dielectric loading), responsivity (sensitivity weighted by resonance sharpness), and the electric field confinement area. Simulations were conducted using Ansys HFSS using the properties of a commercially available photoresist (Shipley 1813) as a dielectric load to assess performance under conditions comparable to previous experimental studies. The analysis showed that while sensitivity remained broadly similar across geometries, responsivity and quality factor differed substantially between resonators. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of the electric field and current density, particularly in rotated configurations, was found to significantly impact coupling efficiency between the resonator and transmission line. Our findings provide guidance for the general design of systems employing THz sensors while establishing a framework with which to benchmark future sensor geometries."

    "research_summary": "We propose a novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method for sampling from unnormalized target distributions based on a reverse denoising diffusion process. While recent diffusion-based samplers simulate the reverse diffusion using approximate score functions, they can suffer from accumulating errors due to time discretization and imperfect score estimation. In this work, we introduce a principled SMC framework that formalizes diffusion-based samplers as proposals while systematically correcting for their biases. The core idea is to construct informative intermediate target distributions that progressively steer the sampling trajectory toward the final target distribution. Although ideal intermediate targets are intractable, we develop exact approximations using quantities from the score estimation-based proposal, without requiring additional model training or inference overhead. The resulting sampler, termed Reverse Diffusion Sequential Monte Carlo, enables consistent sampling and unbiased estimation of the target's normalization constant under mild conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic targets and real-world Bayesian inference problems. Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant prediction. Modern deep learning models generalize remarkably well in-distribution, despite being overparametrized and trained with little to no explicit regularization. Instead, current theory credits implicit regularization imposed by the choice of architecture, hyperparameters and optimization procedure. However, deep neural networks can be surprisingly non-robust, resulting in overconfident predictions and poor out-of-distribution generalization. Bayesian deep learning addresses this via model averaging, but typically requires significant computational resources as well as carefully elicited priors to avoid overriding the benefits of implicit regularization. Instead, in this work, we propose to regularize variational neural networks solely by relying on the implicit bias of (stochastic) gradient descent. We theoretically characterize this inductive bias in overparametrized linear models as generalized variational inference and demonstrate the importance of the choice of parametrization. Empirically, our approach demonstrates strong in- and out-of-distribution performance without additional hyperparameter tuning and with minimal computational overhead. In recent years, there has been much work on scaling Bayesian Optimization to high-dimensional problems, for example hyperparameter tuning in large machine learning models. These scalable methods have been successful, finding high objective values much more quickly than traditional global Bayesian Optimization or random search-based methods. At the same time, these large models often use sensitive data, but preservation of Differential Privacy has not scaled alongside these modern Bayesian Optimization procedures. Here we develop a method to privately optimize potentially high-dimensional parameter spaces using privatized Gradient Informative Bayesian Optimization. Our theoretical results show that under suitable conditions, our method converges exponentially fast to a locally optimal parameter configuration, up to a natural privacy error. Moreover, regardless of whether the assumptions are satisfied, we prove that our algorithm maintains privacy and empirically display superior performance to existing methods in the high-dimensional hyperparameter setting."

    "research_summary": "This paper presents a mobile robotic system designed for autonomous navigation and forest and tree trait estimation, with a focus on the location of individual trees and the diameter of the trunks. The system integrates light detection and ranging data and images using a framework based on simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and a deep learning model for trunk segmentation and tree keypoint detection. Field experiments conducted in a wooded area in Udine, Italy, using a skid-steered mobile robot, demonstrate the effectiveness of the system in navigating, while avoiding obstacles (even in cases where the Global Navigation Satellite System signal is not reliable). The results highlight that the proposed robotic system is capable of autonomously generating maps of forests as point clouds with minimal drift thanks to the loop closure strategy integrated in the SLAM algorithm, and estimating tree traits automatically."

    "research_summary": "Objective Registering a preoperative 3D model of an organ with its actual anatomy viewed from an intraoperative video is a fundamental challenge in computer-assisted surgery, especially for surgical augmented reality. To address this, we present a benchmark of state-of-the-art deep learning point-cloud registration methods, offering a transparent evaluation of their generalizability to surgical scenarios and establishing a robust guideline for developing advanced non-rigid algorithms. Methods We systematically evaluate traditional and deep learning GMM-based, correspondence-based, correspondence-free, matching-based, and liver-specific point cloud registration approaches on two surgical datasets: a deformed IRCAD liver set and DePoll dataset. We also propose our complete-to-partial point cloud registration framework that leverages keypoint extraction, overlap estimation, and a Transformer-based architecture, culminating in competitive registration results. Results Experimental evaluations on deformed IRCAD tests reveal that most deep learning methods achieve good registration performances with TRE&amp;lt;10 mm, MAE(R) &amp;lt; 4 and MAE(t)&amp;lt;5 mm. On DePoll, however, performance drops dramatically due to the large deformations. Conclusion In conclusion, deep-learning rigid registration methods remain reliable under small deformations and varying partiality but lose accuracy when faced with severe non-rigid changes. To overcome this, future work should focus on building non-rigid registration architectures that preserve the strengths of self-, cross-attention and overlap modules while enhancing correspondence estimation to handle large deformations in laparoscopic surgery. Early-stage screening of laryngeal cancer is crucial to lowering patient mortality and morbidity. Laryngoscopyhas become the standard for optical biopsy and is routinely used in clinics to monitor laryngeal tissues. However, this monitoring is inherently subjective and prone to intra- and inter- clinician variability. To mitigate this issue, several computer-assisted solutions have been proposed in the literature to support clinicians in the timely diagnosis and intervention of laryngeal cancer. A crucial preliminary step in the design of such systems is the selection of informative laryngoscopic video frames. This can reduce the amount of data to process and improve diagnostic performance by mimicking the clinician\u2019s focus on high-quality content. Selecting anatomically relevant frames is essential to the performance of the computer-assisted diagnosis system, which is trained to recognize disease in that specific part of the anatomy. This study investigates threedifferent convolutional neural networks (CNN) to automatically identify anatomically relevant frames.

    "research_summary": "BACKGROUND Existing clinical tools do not comprehensively assess gait patterns in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) across all planes or account for spatiotemporal and kinematic parameters. This study investigated the feasibility of the Wisconsin Gait Scale (WGS), originally designed to evaluate hemiparetic gait after stroke, in individuals with the spastic hemiplegic subtype of MS. MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included 30 patients with the spastic hemiplegic subtype of MS. The WGS-based assessment of participants' gait was performed twice, by 3 independent raters. The results of the 2 measurements reported by the 3 raters were compared to determine intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. The WGS scores were also compared with results of clinical tools: the 10-Meter Walk Test, the 2-Minute Walk Test, and the Timed Up and Go Test, to determine the concurrent criterion validity of the WGS. RESULTS A comparison of the scores assigned by the same rater during measurement 1 and measurement 2 showed excellent agreement in each case, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) equal to or higher than 0.991. Likewise, there was excellent agreement between the scores awarded by the 3 raters, both in measurement 1 and measurement 2, with ICCs of 0.988 and 0.978, respectively. The analyses showed very strong and significant correlations (P<0.001) between the mean scores in the WGS and all the clinical tests applied in this study to assess gait. CONCLUSIONS The findings show excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliability and confirm the concurrent criterion validity of the WGS in patients with hemiplegic MS. Standardised assessment of post-stroke motor impairment and treatment responsiveness remains a major clinical challenge. In this study, we tackle this challenge by applying a novel muscle network analysis framework to stroke survivors undergoing intensive upper-limb motor training. Our approach revealed distinct patterns of redundant and synergistic muscle interactions, collectively reflecting the diverse biomechanical roles of flexor- and extensor-driven networks. From these patterns, we derived new biomarkers that stratified patients by impairment severity and therapeutic responsiveness, each associated with unique physiological signatures. Notably, we identified a shift from redundancy to synergy in muscle coordination as a hallmark of effective rehabilitation\u2014a transformation supported by a more precise quantification of treatment outcomes. These findings offer an in-depth functional characterisation of post-stroke motor recovery and establish a robust, independent tool for evaluating rehabilitation efficacy.

    "research_summary": "General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world, advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control. This report introduces the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5, a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general. Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to \"think before acting\" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex, multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can solve complex multi-step tasks. Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers and binary black hole eccentricity and provide early warnings for multimessenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today\u2019s mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10- to 30-hertz band by over 30x and up to 100x in subbands, surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future gravitational wave observatories and, more broadly, instrumentation and control systems. Imitation Learning from Observation (IfO) offers a powerful way to learn behaviors at large-scale: Unlike behavior cloning or offline reinforcement learning, IfO can leverage action-free demonstrations and thus circumvents the need for costly action-labeled demonstrations or reward functions. However, current IfO research focuses on idealized scenarios with mostly bimodal-quality data distributions, restricting the meaningfulness of the results. In contrast, this paper investigates more nuanced distributions and introduces a method to learn from such data, moving closer to a paradigm in which imitation learning can be performed iteratively via self-improvement. Our method adapts RL-based imitation learning to action-free demonstrations, using a value function to transfer information between expert and non-expert data. Through comprehensive evaluation, we delineate the relation between different data distributions and the applicability of algorithms and highlight the limitations of established methods. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing more robust and practical IfO techniques on a path to scalable behaviour learning. Abstract Tokamak \u00e0 configuration variable (TCV), recently celebrating 30 years of near-continual operation, continues in its missions to advance outstanding key physics and operational scenario issues for ITER and the design of future power plants such as DEMO. The main machine heating systems and operational changes are first described. Then follow five sections: plasma scenarios. ITER Base-Line (IBL) discharges, triangularity studies together with X3 heating and N2 seeding. Edge localised mode suppression, with a high radiation region near the X-point is reported with N 2 injection with and without divertor baffles in a snowflake configuration. Negative triangularity (NT) discharges attained record, albeit transient, \u03b2 N \u223c 3 with lower turbulence, higher low-Z impurity transport, vertical stability and density limits and core transport better than the IBL. Positive triangularity L-Mode linear and saturated ohmic confinement confinement saturation, often-correlated with intrinsic toroidal rotation reversals, was probed for D, H and He working gases. H-mode confinement and pedestal studies were extended to low collisionality with electron cyclotron heating obtaining steady state electron iternal transport barrier with neutral beam heating (NBH), and NBH driven H-mode configurations with off-axis co-electron cyclotron current drive. Fast particle physics. The physics of disruptions, runaway electrons and fast ions (FIs) was developed using near-full current conversion at disruption with recombination thresholds characterised for impurity species (Ne, Ar, Kr).

    "research_summary": "Purpose The purpose of this study is to analyze the robot trends of the next generation. Design/methodology/approach This paper is divided into two sections: the key modern technology on which Europe's robotics industry has built its foundation is described. Then, the next key megatrends were analyzed. Findings Artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics are technologies of major importance for the development of humanity. This time is mature for the evolution of industrial and service robots. The perception of robot use has changed from threading to aiding. The cost of mass production of technological devices is decreasing, while a rich set of enabling technologies is under development. Soft mechanisms, 5G and AI have enabled us to address a wide range of new problems. Ethics should guide human behavior in addressing this newly available powerful technology in the right direction. Originality/value The paper describes the impact of new technology, such as AI and soft robotics. The world of work must react quickly to these epochal changes to enjoy their full benefits. Abstract From the list of interfaces used in virtual reality systems, haptic interfaces allow users to touch a virtual world with their hands. Traditionally, the user\u2019s hand moves the end-effector of a robotic arm. When there is no contact in the virtual world, the robotic arm is passive; when there is contact, the arm suppresses mobility to the user\u2019s hand in certain directions. Unfortunately, the passive mode is never completely seamless to the user. Haptic interfaces with intermittent contacts are interfaces using industrial robots that move towards the user when contact needs to be made. As the user is immersed in the virtual world via a virtual reality head mounted display (HMD), he cannot perceive the danger of a collision when he changes his area of interest in the virtual environment. The objective of this article is to describe four movement strategies for the robot to be as fast as possible on the contact zone while guaranteeing safety. This work uses the concept of predicting the user\u2019s intention through his gaze direction and the position of his dominant hand (the one touching the object) and safe-points outside the human workspace. Experiments are done and analyzed with a Pareto front with a UR5 robot, an HTC vive tracker system for an industrial application involving the analysis of materials in the interior of a car. For haptic interaction, a user in a virtual environment needs to interact with proxies attached to a robot. The device must be at the exact location defined in the virtual environment in time. However, due to device limitations, delays are always unavoidable. One of the solutions to improve the device response is to infer human intended motion and move the robot at the earliest time possible to the desired goal. This paper presents an experimental study to improve the prediction time and reduce the robot time taken to reach the desired position. We developed motion strategies based on the hand motion and eye-gaze direction to determine the point of user interaction in a virtual environment. To assess the performance of the strategies, we conducted a subject-based experiment using an exergame for reach and grab tasks designed for upper limb rehabilitation training. The experimental results in this study revealed that eye-gaze-based prediction significantly improved the detection time by 37% and the robot time taken to reach the target by 27%. Further analysis provided more insight on the effect of the eye-gaze window and the hand threshold on the device response for the experimental task. &amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Abstract&amp;mdash;Before attaining full autonomy by autonomous&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;vehicles, impact of human interference is significant while&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;achieving full automated driving system. Thus, it creates a&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;fundamental challenge to have a safe and smooth takeover&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;by the driver from the automated system until vehicles are&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;completely autonomous. In this paper, we study two strategies&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;for taking control of autonomous freight vehicle. First being&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;the haptic takeover control method in which drivers cognitive&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;workload and drivers readiness is evaluated during the Take&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Over Request (TOR). In the haptic takeover feedback, the process&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;overcomes challenges in driver-automation collaboration&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;during handover transitions between human and automated&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;vehicles. In the second strategy, we analyze the need for Take&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Over Request, system behaviour during the Take Over-Request&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;phasehow the system should react during a TOR phase, and&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;the procedures that should be followed during the TOR to have&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;a safe and comfortable take over the transition.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;"

Electromagnetic Navigation Systems for Minimally Invasive Surgery Magnetic navigation systems (MNSs) are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures. Widespread adoption is currently limited by the size and limits of the current generation of MNSs. In article number 2310701, Simone Gervasoni, Salvador Pan\u00e9, Bradley J. Nelson, and co-workers present a new generation of a human-scale mobile eMNS, capable of manipulating tethered robotic catheters and untethered magnetic microrobots. Abstract Magnetic navigation systems are used to precisely manipulate magnetically responsive materials enabling the realization of new minimally invasive procedures using magnetic medical devices. Their widespread applicability has been constrained by high infrastructure demands and costs. The study reports on a portable electromagnetic navigation system, the Navion, which is capable of generating a large magnetic field over a large workspace. The system is easy to install in hospital operating rooms and transportable through health care facilities, aiding in the widespread adoption of magnetically responsive medical devices. First, the design and implementation approach for the system are introduced and its performance is characterized. Next, in vitro navigation of different microrobot structures is demonstrated using magnetic field gradients and rotating magnetic fields. Spherical permanent magnets, electroplated cylindrical microrobots, microparticle swarms, and magnetic composite bacteria\u2010inspired helical structures are investigated. The navigation of magnetic catheters is also demonstrated in two challenging endovascular tasks: 1) an angiography procedure and 2) deep navigation within the circle of Willis. Catheter navigation is demonstrated in a porcine model in vivo to perform an angiography under magnetic guidance. In minimally invasive surgery, such as cardiac ablation, magnetically steered catheters made of variable-stiffness materials can enable higher dexterity and higher force application to human tissue. However, the long transition time between soft and rigid states leads to a significant increase in procedure duration. Here, a fast-response, multisegmented catheter is described for minimally invasive surgery made of variable-stiffness thread (FRVST) that encapsulates a helical cooling channel. The rapid stiffness change in the FRVST, composed of a nontoxic shape memory polymer, is achieved by an active cooling system that pumps water through the helical channel. The FRVST displays a 66 times stiffness change and a 26 times transition enhancement compare with the noncooled version. The catheter allows for selective bending of each segment up to 127\u00b0 in air and up to 76\u00b0 in water under an 80 mT external magnetic field. The inner working channel can be used for cooling an ablation tip during a procedure and for information exchange via the deployment of wires or surgical tools."

    "research_summary": "Nanosatellites have established their importance in low-Earth orbit (LEO), and it is common for student teams to build them for educational and technology demonstration purposes. The next challenge is the technology maturity for deep-space missions. The LEO serves as a relevant environment for maturing the spacecraft design. Here we present the ESTCube-2 mission, which will be launched onboard VEGA-C VV23. The satellite was developed as a technology demonstrator for the future deep-space mission by the Estonian Student Satellite Program. The ultimate vision of the program is to use the electric solar wind sail (E-sail) technology in an interplanetary environment to traverse the solar system using lightweight propulsion means. Additional experiments were added to demonstrate all necessary technologies to use the E-sail payload onboard ESTCube-3, the next nanospacecraft targeting the lunar orbit. The E-sail demonstration requires a high-angular velocity spin-up to deploy a tether, resulting in a need for a custom satellite bus. In addition, the satellite includes deep-space prototypes: deployable structures; compact avionics stack electronics (including side panels); star tracker; reaction wheels; and cold\u2013gas propulsion. During the development, two additional payloads were added to the design of ESTCube-2, one for Earth observation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the other for corrosion testing in the space of thin-film materials. The ESTCube-2 satellite has been finished and tested in time for delivery to the launcher. Eventually, the project proved highly complex, making the team lower its ambitions and optimize the development of electronics, software, and mechanical structure. The ESTCube-2 team dealt with budgetary constraints, student management problems during a pandemic, and issues in the documentation approach. Beyond management techniques, the project required leadership that kept the team aware of the big picture and willing to finish a complex satellite platform. The paper discusses the ESTCube-2 design and its development, highlights the team\u2019s main technical, management, and leadership issues, and presents suggestions for nanosatellite and nanospacecraft developers. Here we present the development and qualification of the highly integrated satellite avionics stack of ESTCube-2, a three-unit CubeSat carrying various in-orbit demonstration payloads. The primary payload is the Plasma Brake (PB), which is novel deorbiting technology for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The Earth observation payload (EOP) consists of two cameras imaging the planet in 660 nm and 857 nm spectral bands. Finally, the Corrosion Testing in Space (CTS) experiment will study the behavior of a nanostructured coating in the LEO environment. A major innovation of the satellite's design is a highly integrated avionics stack platform, to be demonstrated in LEO as a prototype of future interplanetary nanospacecraft platforms. The electrical power system, the communications, the on-board computer, and the attitude and orbit control solution together occupy a volume smaller than one CubeSat unit. The avionics stack electronics firmware uses a unified and custom hardware abstraction layer (HAL) for STMicroelectronics STM32F7 and STM32L4 microcontrollers. This paper presents the integrated design of the satellite avionics stack, preliminary results of functional and qualification tests, and discusses the engineering challenges that the team has been facing. In this article, we introduce an alternative solution for forest regeneration based on unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) and describe requirements for external data, which could significantly increase the level of automation. Over the past few decades, the global forested area has decreased, and there is a great need to restore and regenerate forests. Challenges such as the lack of labor and high costs demand innovative approaches for forest regeneration. Mechanization has shown satisfactory results in terms of time-efficient planting, although its usage is limited by high operational costs. Innovative technologies must be cost-efficient and profitable for large scale usage. Automation could make mechanized forest regeneration feasible. Forest regeneration operations can be automated using a purpose built unmanned platform. We developed a concept to automate forest planting operations based on mobility platform. The system requires external data for efficient mobility in clear-cut areas. We developed requirements for external data, analyzed available solutions, and experimented with the most promising option, the SfM (structure from motion) technique. Earth observation data are useful in the planning phase. A DEM (digital terrain model) for UGV planter operations can be constructed using ALS (airborne laser scanning), although it may be restricted by the cost. Low-altitude flights by drones equipped with digital cameras or lightweight laser scanners provided a usab"

    "research_summary": "Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator. Generative large language models (LLMs) have become crucial for modern NLP research and applications across various languages. However, the development of foundational models specifically tailored to the Russian language has been limited, primarily due to the significant computational resources required. This paper introduces the GigaChat family of Russian LLMs, available in various sizes, including base models and instruction-tuned versions. We provide a detailed report on the model architecture, pre-training process, and experiments to guide design choices. In addition, we evaluate their performance on Russian and English benchmarks and compare GigaChat with multilingual analogs. The paper presents a system demonstration of the top-performing models accessible via an API, a Telegram bot, and a Web interface. Furthermore, we have released three open GigaChat models in open-source (https://huggingface.co/ai-sage), aiming to expand NLP research opportunities and support the development of industrial solutions for the Russian language. Recent advancements in large multimodal models have led to the emergence of remarkable generalist capabilities in digital domains, yet their translation to physical agents such as robots remains a significant challenge. This report introduces a new family of AI models purposefully designed for robotics and built upon the foundation of Gemini 2.0. We present Gemini Robotics, an advanced Vision-Language-Action (VLA) generalist model capable of directly controlling robots. Gemini Robotics executes smooth and reactive movements to tackle a wide range of complex manipulation tasks while also being robust to variations in object types and positions, handling unseen environments as well as following diverse, open vocabulary instructions. We show that with additional fine-tuning, Gemini Robotics can be specialized to new capabilities including solving long-horizon, highly dexterous tasks, learning new short-horizon tasks from as few as 100 demonstrations and adapting to completely novel robot embodiments. This is made possible because Gemini Robotics builds on top of the Gemini Robotics-ER model, the second model we introduce in this work. Gemini Robotics-ER (Embodied Reasoning) extends Gemini's multimodal reasoning capabilities into the physical world, with enhanced spatial and temporal understanding. This enables capabilities relevant to robotics including object detection, pointing, trajectory and grasp prediction, as well as multi-view correspondence and 3D bounding box predictions. We show how this novel combination can support a variety of robotics applications. We also discuss and address important safety considerations related to this new class of robotics foundation models. The Gemini Robotics family marks a substantial step towards developing general-purpose robots that realizes AI's potential in the physical world. In this report, we introduce the Gemini 1.5 family of models, representing the next generation of highly compute-efficient multimodal models capable of recalling and reasoning over fine-grained information from millions of tokens of context, including multiple long documents and hours of video and audio.

    "research_summary": "Millions of patients and their caretakers live and deal with the devastating consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) worldwide. Despite outstanding advances in the field to both understand and tackle these pathologies, a cure for SCI patients, with their peculiar characteristics, is still a mirage. One of the most promising therapeutic strategies to date for these patients involves the use of epidural electrical stimulation. In this context, electrically active materials such as graphene and its derivates become particularly interesting. Indeed, solid evidence of their capacity to closely interact with neural cells and networks is growing. Encouraged by previous findings in our laboratory on the exploration of 3D porous reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scaffolds in chronic cervical hemisected rats (C6), herein we report their neuro-reparative properties when chronically implanted in complete transected rats (T9-T10), in which no preserved contralateral neural networks can assist in any observed recovery. Electrophysiological recordings from brainstem regions show antidromic activation of a small population of neurons in response to electrical stimulation caudal to the injury. These neurons are located in the Gigantocellular nucleus of reticular formation and vestibular nuclei, both regions directly related to motor functions. Together with histological features at the lesion site, such as more abundant and larger blood vessels and more abundant, longer and more homogeneously distributed axons, our results corroborate that rGO scaffolds create a permissive environment that allows the invasion of functional axonic processes from neurons located in brainstem nuclei with motor function in a rat model of complete thoracic transection. Additionally, behavioral tests evidence that these scaffolds play an important role in whole-body mechanical stabilization (postural control) proved by the absence of scoliosis, a higher trunk stability and a larger cervico-thoraco-lumbar movement range in rGO-implanted rats. Background/Objectives: Overall priorities of the international pediatric-onset spinal cord injury (SCI) population are unknown. The purpose was to describe and compare Life and Health (L&amp;H) domain overall priorities of European youth with SCI and their parents and caregivers (P&amp;C). Methods: A survey with a cross-sectional design, prepared by the PEPSCI Collaboration, was conducted in six European countries. In total, 202 participants, including youth with SCI (n = 101) and their P&amp;C (n = 101), were included. Overall priorities were calculated based on unhappiness, importance, and research. Results: The sample included youth aged 8\u201312 years (30.7%) and 13\u201325 years (69.3%; 38.6% 13\u201317-year-olds and 30.7% youth aged 18\u201325 years), in addition to their P&amp;C. The top three L&amp;H priorities highlighted by P&amp;C of the youth aged 8\u201312 years were \u201cbladder\u201d function (78%), \u201cleg/foot movement\u201d (77%), or \u201cbowel\u201d function (74%), compared with \u201cleg/foot movement\u201d (79%), \u201csit-to-stand\u201d (76%), or \u201cwalking/ability to move\u201d (75%) reported by P&amp;C of the youth aged 13\u201325 years. The youth aged 13\u201325 years considered \u201cleg/foot movement\u201d (68%), \u201cbowel\u201d (66%), or \u201cbladder\u201d function (65%) as priorities. The top 10 priorities highlighted by the youth aged 13\u201325 years compared to the top 10 priorities rated by P&amp;C were issues related to \u201cpersonal needs\u201d. Nevertheless, \u201cpressure injuries\u201d, \u201cpain\u201d, \u201cbowel function\u201d, or \u201cmobility in the community\u201d were highlighted as top preferences of priorities for the youth aged 13\u201325 years compared to their P&amp;C. Conclusions: Adolescents/young adults highlighted health domain priorities compared with their P&amp;C, who equally considered L&amp;H domains. Life domains, which were previously unaddressed, were highlighted by P&amp;C, including \u201cadulthood expectations\u201d and \u201cparenthood expectations\u201d. This survey will promote the involvement of stakeholders for comprehensive rehabilitation management for this population. Robic's platform emerges as an innovative technological tool demonstrating adequate usability and also a good user experience in an upper limb training program for PedSCI patients. Future developments, incorporating eye-tracking strategies would help determine the engagement with the proposed task Abstract Electrodes with nanostructured surface have emerged as promising low-impedance neural interfaces that can avoid the charge\u2010injection restrictions typically associated to microelectrodes. In this work, we propose a novel approximation, based on a two-step template assisted electrodeposition technique, to obtain flexible nanostructured electrodes coated with core\u2013shell Ni\u2013Au vertical nanowires. These nanowires benefit from biocompatibility of the Au shell exposed to the environment and the mechanical properties of Ni that allow for nanowires longer and more homogeneous in length than their only-Au counterparts. The nanostructured electrodes show impedance values, m"

    "research_summary": "This article presents iRonCub 3, a jet-powered humanoid robot, and its first flight experiments. Unlike traditional aerial vehicles, iRonCub 3 aims to achieve flight using a full-body humanoid form, which poses unique challenges in control, estimation, and system integration. We highlight the robot's current mechanical and software architecture, including its propulsion system, control framework, and experimental infrastructure. The control and estimation framework is first validated in simulation by performing a takeoff and tracking a reference trajectory. Then, we demonstrate, for the first time, a liftoff of a jet-powered humanoid robot - an initial but significant step toward aerial humanoid mobility. Also, we detail how the experimental area around a jet-powered humanoid robot should be designed in order to deal with a level of complexity that is substantially superior than indoor humanoid robot experiments. This paper presents a novel framework for whole-body torque control of humanoid robots without joint torque sensors, designed for systems with electric motors and high-ratio harmonic drives. The approach integrates Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for friction modeling and Unscented Kalman Filtering (UKF) for joint torque estimation, within a real-time torque control architecture. PINNs estimate nonlinear static and dynamic friction from joint and motor velocity readings, capturing effects like motor actuation without joint movement. The UKF utilizes PINN-based friction estimates as direct measurement inputs, improving torque estimation robustness. Experimental validation on the ergoCub humanoid robot demonstrates improved torque tracking accuracy, enhanced energy efficiency, and superior disturbance rejection compared to the state-of-the-art Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA), using a dynamic balancing experiment. The framework's scalability is shown by consistent performance across robots with similar hardware but different friction characteristics, without re-identification. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with position control highlights the advantages of the proposed torque control approach. The results establish the method as a scalable and practical solution for sensorless torque control in humanoid robots, ensuring torque tracking, adaptability, and stability in dynamic environments. <title>Abstract</title> Collaboration is an inherent aspect of human behavior, enabling tasks that are otherwise impossible for individuals alone. This collaborative ability stems from the capacity of individuals to coordinate their actions by leveraging internal representations of their companions\u2014a concept known as shared intelligence. Additionally, humans are characterized by physical bodies and cognitive abilities that are optimized in response to their environment, a phenomenon referred to as embodied cognition. In this paper, we propose an architecture that combines shared intelligence and embodied cognition to enable robots to physically collaborate with humans, where robot hardware and control are optimized for human metrics, using representations of the human body and motion intelligence. By doing so, our ultimate aim is to design humanoid robots that possess a degree of shared embodied intelligence. More specifically, the proposed architecture optimizes the robot\u2019s hardware and physical intelligence parameters with respect to human ergonomic metrics. We achieve this by deriving models of human-robot interaction parameterized with respect to the robot\u2019s hardware configurations and by incorporating human models into the robot\u2019s physical intelligence. As a tangible outcome of the proposed architecture, we present the humanoid robot ergoCub, whose body and physical intelligence have been optimized for performing collaborative actions with humans. Our approach yields concrete results in designing humanoid robots that prioritize human ergonomics at both the hardware and physical intelligence levels. The potential applications of this approach span diverse fields, including industrial and assistive robotics."

    "research_summary": "Objective: To investigate changes in tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis activity during walking following a diagnostic nerve block of the tibial nerve in patients with spastic equinovarus foot. Design: Observational pilot study. Patients: Thirteen adult patients (10 males, 3 females) with spastic equinovarus foot due to stroke or traumatic brain injury. Methods: All patients underwent a diagnostic nerve block of the tibial nerve main trunk. Clinical assessments included passive and active ankle range of motion, spasticity grading using the Modified Ashworth Scale and the Tardieu Scale, and muscle strength evaluation. Surface electromyography was recorded during gait to analyse muscle activation and coactivation patterns before and after the procedure. Results: Passive ankle dorsiflexion significantly improved after the nerve block. Spasticity scores decreased, while active range of motion and Tardieu angle (passive range of motion during slow stretch \u2013 angle at which resistance is first felt during fastest stretch) showed trends toward improvement. Electromyographic analysis revealed reduced activation of both tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius medialis, along with a significant decrease in coactivation. Conclusion: Diagnostic nerve block of the tibial nerve effectively reduces spasticity and alters antagonist muscle activity, supporting its role in personalized assessment and treatment planning for spastic equinovarus foot. Investigating how cognitive and motor functions interact in people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) is key to identifying disease-related alterations, yet technical challenges have long hindered this research. We introduce an innovative framework for dual-task (DT) assessment in PwMS, integrating wearable electroencephalography (EEG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors. The study involved 11 PwMS (6 males, 5 females; mean age: 58.5 \u00b1 12.5 years), who performed the timed up and go (TUG) test under two conditions: a motor task as single-task (ST) and a motor-cognitive DT. A custom-made bracelet including an IMU and a wearable EEG device allowed the recording of motion data and brain activity during the tasks. The former was used for automatic trial segmentation through a hybrid convolutional neural network and a long-shortterm-memory model. This allowed the extraction of the EEG epoch during the task. Finally, the power spectral density in \u03b8 (4-8 Hz) and \u03b1 (8-12 Hz) frequency bands was analyzed to extract mental workload. The proposed segmentation method achieved accurate estimations when compared to manual video-based labeling, with a very strong correlation R<sup>2</sup>=0.993 and mean-absolute-error of 0.383 s and 0.294 s for the ST and DT conditions, respectively. The EEG results showed increased mental workload during the DT condition (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p-value = 0.02). The planned inclusion of new participants will help to confirm the robustness of cortical activity patterns during DT performances in PwMS.Clinical relevance-The proposed experimental protocol represents a significant step forward to the understanding of neural correlates of cognitive-motor interaction, allowing the recording of cortical activity during walking. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the association between DT performance and risk of falls in PwMS and help design specific and personalized rehabilitation interventions. We formulate a detailed computational account of sensory attenuation in force-matching tasks that disambiguates contributions of perceptual, memory, and prediction noise to isolate a pure measure of attenuation strength. Analysis of data from nearly 500 participants shows that attenuated sensations display increased trial-to-trial variability, consistent with incorporating additional noise inherent to motor prediction. These results support a divisive, rather than subtractive, reduction in the sensation of self-generated forces based on predicted reafference.

    "research_summary": "In remote magnetic navigation, a magnetic navigation system is used to generate magnetic fields to apply mechanical wrenches to steer a magnetic object. This technique can be applied to navigate untethered micro- and nanorobots, as well as tethered magnetic surgical tools for minimally invasive medicine. The design and characterization of these systems have been extensively investigated over the past decade. The determination of the region in space in which these systems can operate has yet to be formalized within the research community. This region is commonly referred to as the \u201cworkspace\u201d and constitutes a central concept for any class of robotic system. We focus on magnetic navigation systems comprised of electromagnets and propose a first set of definitions for a magnetic workspace, a methodology to determine it, and evaluation metrics to analyze its characteristics. Our methodology and tools are illustrated with several examples of planar and spatial electromagnetic magnetic navigation systems for both didactic and realistic navigation scenarios. ISSN:1552-3098 Retinal disorders, including age-related macular degeneration, are leading causes of vision loss worldwide. New treatments, such as gene therapies and stem cell regeneration, require therapeutics to be introduced to the subretinal space due to poor diffusion to the active component of the retina. Subretinal injections are a difficult and risky surgical procedure and have been suggested as a candidate for robot-assisted surgery. We propose a different actuation paradigm to existing robotic approaches using remote magnetic navigation to control a flexible microcannula. A flexible cannula allows for high dexterity and considerable safety advantages over rigid tools, while maintaining the benefits of micrometer precision, hand tremor removal, and telemanipulation. The position of the cannula is tracked in real-time using near-infrared tip illumination, allowing for semi-automatic placement of the cannula and an intuitive user interface. Using this tool, we successfully performed several subretinal injections in ex-vivo porcine eyes under both microscope and optical coherence tomography visualization."

    "research_summary": "We propose the Extended Reality Universal Planning Toolkit (ERUPT), an extended reality (XR) system for interactive motion planning. Our system allows users to create and dynamically reconfigure environments while they plan robot paths. In immersive three-dimensional XR environments, users gain a greater spatial understanding. XR also unlocks a broader range of natural interaction capabilities, allowing users to grab and adjust objects in the environment similarly to the real world, rather than using a mouse and keyboard with the scene projected onto a two-dimensional computer screen. Our system integrates with MoveIt, a manipulation planning framework, allowing users to send motion planning requests and visualize the resulting robot paths in virtual or augmented reality. We provide a broad range of interaction modalities, allowing users to modify objects in the environment and interact with a virtual robot. Our system allows operators to visualize robot motions, ensuring desired behavior as it moves throughout the environment, without risk of collisions within a virtual space, and to then deploy planned paths on physical robots in the real world. One approach to using prior experience in robot motion planning is to store solutions to previously seen problems in a database of paths. Methods that use such databases are characterized by how they query for a path and how they use queries given a new problem. In this work we present a new method, Path Database Guidance (PDG), which innovates on existing work in two ways. First, we use the database to compute a heuristic for determining which nodes of a search tree to expand, in contrast to prior work which generally pastes the (possibly transformed) queried path or uses it to bias a sampling distribution. We demonstrate that this makes our method more easily composable with other search methods by dynamically interleaving exploration according to a baseline algorithm with exploitation of the database guidance. Second, in contrast to other methods that treat the database as a single fixed prior, our database (and thus our queried heuristic) updates as we search the implicitly defined robot configuration space. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of PDG in a variety of explicitly defined environment distributions in simulation."

    "research_summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive approach to teaching an elementary structural engineering course, emphasizing a balanced integration of theoretical instruction, practical application, and student-centered pedagogy. Aimed at undergraduate civil engineering students, the course introduces essential concepts in structural behavior, mechanics, and material properties while fostering critical thinking and problem-solving skills necessary for advanced studies and professional practice. The curriculum is designed to build foundational knowledge through modules covering topics such as forces and loads, truss and beam analysis, and introductory design principles. Pedagogical strategies include traditional lectures enhanced with visual aids, collaborative problem-solving, and the use of structural analysis software to bridge classroom learning with real-world engineering tools. A flipped classroom model and hands-on laboratory experiences\u2014such as material testing and small-scale model building\u2014further reinforce learning outcomes by connecting theory with application. The paper also addresses common challenges faced in delivering this course, including the abstract nature of structural concepts, the mathematical rigor involved, and the need to maintain student engagement. Practical solutions, such as the use of analogies, step-by-step demonstrations, and supportive learning environments, are proposed to overcome these obstacles. Ultimately, the course aims to instill in students a strong foundation in structural engineering principles, a working knowledge of professional standards and codes, and a capacity for innovation and ethical decision-making. This foundational experience not only prepares students for advanced coursework but also equips them to contribute meaningfully to the future of infrastructure development and safety."

    "research_summary": "Lamivudine/dolutegravir (3TC/DTG) is effective and safe for most people with HIV infection (PWH) who are virologically suppressed, but specific individual\u2019s characteristics, such as previous detection of archived resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) to 3TC and prior HBV infection, could represent a risk for virological failure (VF). We conducted a retrospective monocentric cohort study to assess rates and predictors of treatment discontinuation (TD) and VF in PWH switched to 3TC/DTG after reaching virological suppression (HIV-RNA&amp;amp;lt;50 cp/mL). Overall, 188 PWH were included. Over 5145 patient-years follow-up (PYFU), 16 (8.5%) PWH experienced TD (2.87 per 1000 PYFU), whereas over 5082 PYFU, 8 (4.3%) experienced VF (1.45 per 1000 PYFU). Probabilities of TD and VF were 1.3%, 2.8%, 7.5%, 12.9%, 34.5% and 0.6%, 2.7%, 2.7%, 4.2%, 22.3% after 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years respectively. Independent predictors of VF were a detectable baseline HIV-RNA of 20-49 copies/ml (versus&amp;amp;lt;20 copies/ml, aHR 9.11, 95 % CI 1.05-79.40; p= 0.046), and a higher GSS-score for 3TC (per 10 points more, aHR 1.57, 95 % CI 1.07-2.29; p= 0.023), with a borderline significance for anti-HBcAg positive serostatus (versus negative, aHR 8.88, 95 % CI 0.89-88.45; p= 0.062). After adjustment for age and gender, those with anti-HBcAg positivity who switched from a tenofovir-containing regimen had the highest risk of VF (versus negative anti-HBcAg and no prior tenofovir use, aHR 15.06, 95% CI 1.40-161.38; p-value= 0.025). ----- In this paper we present the preliminary evaluation of an active soft bellow exoskeleton for assistance during overhead tasks. The evaluation was performed using objective (i.e., joint angles and muscle activations) and subjective (i.e., Borg Cr R-10 and System Usability Scale - SUS scales) measurements. The subject, involved in the experimental campaign, performed in laboratory conditions a drilling overhead task typical of the automotive industry, once using the exoskeleton and once without the exoskeleton. The preliminary results underlined the positive effect of the exoskeleton in terms of physical effort and usability."

    "research_summary": "Subway systems are highly vulnerable to disasters because of their confined underground structures and limited evacuation routes, making accurate evacuation analysis essential for reducing casualties. Most existing studies overlook panic behavior, leading to unrealistic assessments of evacuation efficiency. This study develops a modeling framework that integrates panic behavior into agent-based subway evacuation simulations. The framework incorporates three behavioral factors: reaction delays to emergency cues, hesitation at decision points, and irrational route choices. Simulation experiments were conducted under different occupancy conditions, and results from panic-integrated and non-panic scenarios were compared. Findings show that the inclusion of panic significantly prolongs evacuation time, with delays of up to 30% in full-scale scenarios due to congestion and route errors. These outcomes demonstrate that panic behavior exerts a decisive influence on evacuation dynamics and should not be neglected in simulation studies. Incorporating panic into evacuation modeling provides a more realistic basis for designing safer subway systems and developing effective emergency response strategies. This study presents a novel system for accurate camera-to-person distance estimation in CCTV environments. To address the limitations of existing approaches\u2014which often require extensive training data and lack object-level precision\u2014we propose a hybrid framework that integrates SAM\u2019s zero-shot segmentation with monocular depth estimation. Our method isolates human subjects from complex backgrounds and incorporates Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), log-space learning, and linear residual blocks to improve prediction accuracy. This approach is designed to resolve the non-linear mapping between visual features and metric distances. Evaluations on a custom dataset demonstrate a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.65 m on 1612 test images, using only 30 training samples. Notably, the use of SAM for fine-grained segmentation significantly outperforms conventional bounding box methods, reducing the MAE from 0.82 m to 0.65 m. The proposed system offers immediate applicability to security surveillance and disaster response scenarios, with its minimal data requirements enhancing its practical deployability. Human action recognition systems enhance public safety by detecting abnormal behavior autonomously. RGB sensors commonly used in such systems capture personal information of subjects and, as a result, run the risk of potential privacy leakage. On the other hand, privacy-safe alternatives, such as depth or thermal sensors, exhibit poorer performance because they lack the semantic context provided by RGB sensors. Moreover, the data availability of privacy-safe alternatives is significantly lower than RGB sensors. To address these problems, we explore effective cross-modality distillation methods in this paper, aiming to distill the knowledge of context-rich large-scale pre-trained RGB-based models into privacy-safe depth-based models. Based on extensive experiments on multiple architectures and benchmark datasets, we propose an effective method for training privacy-safe depth-based action recognition models via cross-modality distillation: cross-modality mixing distillation. This approach improves both the performance and efficiency by enabling interaction between depth and RGB modalities through a linear combination of their features. By utilizing the proposed cross-modal mixing distillation approach, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in two depth-based action recognition benchmarks. The code and the pre-trained models will be available upon publication. In this study, a cloud-based real-time building health monitoring and prediction system using AI and IoT sensors was developed. To predict the building condition, which constitutes time-series data, statistical-based ARIMA and AI-based LSTM prediction models were designed, and the effectiveness of the proposed prediction models was experimentally verified using a 1/8-scaled miniaturized structure. The prediction accuracy in terms of MAPE (less than 1%) was experimentally confirmed to be satisfactory. Moreover, a method for analyzing dimensional structure deformation was developed by combining multiple sensor measurements, and its effectiveness was verified through the case study of a real earthquake-damaged building. Abstract Human gaze information has been widely used in various areas, such as medical diagnosis and human\u2013computer interactions (HCI). This study proposes a head pose\u2010free 3D gaze estimation method using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). To infer gaze direction, only a small grayscale image is required without any special devices such as an infrared (IR) illuminator and RGBD sensor. A domain adaptation method to reduce the feature gap between real and synthetic image data is also proposed here. Moreover, a novel synthetic dataset (SynFace) that contains hea"

    "research_summary": "Life expectancy has risen over the world, and countries have faced similar issues irrespectively of their geographic location. Supporting ageing and fragile people to increase their personal autonomy is beneficial to their well-being and to society, since it can help to ease the economic and social issues that come with ageing societies. Physical, cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric impairments, social isolation concerns, and a low quality of life are some of the ageing-related challenges that the population may face due to the demographic change. Active Assisted Living (AAL) technology is gaining popularity to support the elderly to maintain a self-determined life and improve the overall standard of living. It is a key emphasis of gerontechnology, which looks at how technological advancements can support elderly people\u2019s health and well-being. In this chapter, a literature review is conducted to showcase, as well as evaluate, different assisted living technologies in the context of the built environment. The evolving technologies (e.g., assistive technologies, sensory technology, robotics, wireless communication, artificial intelligence) have enabled the development of a variety of ambient or active supported living options. Moreover, different risk factors and ethical concerns in relation to the overall user acceptance are discussed in this chapter. Furthermore, the chapter gives an excursus of AALs in the framework of the pandemic and explores the related fields of application. The chapter concludes with an analysis of the maintaining innovation and implementation barriers that need to be addressed in the near future to establish a built environment which benefits from new technologies and enables elderly people to live a fulfilled and independent life. Population aging is one of the major challenges facing the world. In particular, the advent of China\u2019s aging society caused by various factors will be a major threat to its future development. Therefore, serious measures need to be taken to achieve its demographic sustainability. Smart furniture can be considered as a novel subcategory of gerontechnology. One of the main outcomes of the EU-funded REACH project was a variety of smart furniture named Personalized Intelligent Interior Units (PI2Us) which served as the key component of a distributed intelligent home to promote the health and activity level of older adults. This outcome can potentially be a solution to mitigate the consequences caused by population aging. In order to understand the attitudes and opinions of Chinese older adults towards the relevant technologies, the authors conducted an opinion survey using the PI2Us as an example, which sampled more than 380 older adults in 26 out of 34 provincial-level administrative divisions of China. The survey showed that Chinese older adults in general have a highly positive attitude towards smart furniture and smart home technologies. Several other insights also can be revealed from the survey. Based on further analyses, the paper summarized why the elderly-oriented smart furniture and distributed intelligent home has the potential to thrive in China\u2019s market soon. Finally, a three-year project action plan for implementing localized solutions in cooperation with a large Chinese furniture manufacturer was presented. We hope that ISARC 2021 Towards a Distributed Intelligent Home Based on Smart Furniture for China's Aging Population: A Survey Rongbo Hu, Thomas Linner, Suting Wang, Wenting Cheng, Xiaolong Liu, J\u00f6rg G\u00fcttler, Charlie Zhao, Yuan Lu and Thomas Bock Pages 41-48 (2021 Proceedings of the 38th ISARC, Dubai, UAE, ISBN 978-952-69524-1-3, ISSN 2413-5844) Abstract: Population aging is one of the major challenges facing the world.

These cutting-edge diodes were meticulously grown in-house using the precise technique of molecular beam epitaxy. The proposed RTD showcased remarkable negative-differential resistance characteristics, achieving a cm-2 peak current density (Jp) at V, and a peak-to-valley current ratio of 8.5. A large-signal model of the fabricated RTD was developed in LTspice using experimental current-voltage (I-V) data, enabling the simulation of an RTD-based frequency multiplier circuit. A frequency multiplier with a multiplication factor of three (x3) was created and tested by arranging two RTDs in series to introduce non-linearity in the circuit. The experiment successfully demonstrated a threefold increase in frequency, converting an input signal of 166 MHz (3.07 mW) to an output frequency of 500 MHz (51.57 \u00b5W). The results highlighted the potential of InGaAs/AlAs RTDs for cost-effective ultra-high-frequency applications, particularly for communication systems, radar, and signal processing. Gold-doped high resistivity silicon has shown potential as advanced RF substrate through improved substrate resistivity and RF performances. However, the substrate demonstrates non-linear behavior, indicating insufficient traps to fully pin the Fermi level to intrinsic level. To date, charge-trapping mechanism of the substrate has not been fully understood. This study aims to highlight the effects of process variations in the development of gold-doped high resistivity silicon on the DC and RF performances to gain a deeper insight into the charge-trapping mechanism associated with the substrate. Double-stage activation annealing consists of controlled cooling and rapid cooling illustrates higher resistivity compared to single-stage annealing, with more than 50% increase. In addition to that, CPW losses demonstrate lower dependency on DC bias, reflected by its amax/amin ratio of 1.01 as compared to 1.24 for single-stage annealing. Through this work, it was also found that the substrate is sensitive to high-temperature processing, indicated by the higher amax/amin loss ratio on thermally oxidized substrate, most likely due to the insufficient traps to compensate for the additional thermal generated carriers. Additionally, the removal of gold layer at the silicon surface was unwarranted from the RF perspective, portrayed by the higher CPW losses. Abstract Full adder (FA) is a crucial building block in very-large-scale integration and digital signal processing applications, serving as a versatile component for addition, multiplication, arithmetic logic unit construction, etc. Its importance necessitates the development of an efficient adder block. To achieve high speed and low power consumption, various approaches can be employed. This study aims to implement a 4-bit ripple carry adder (RCA) using conventional, Boolean simplification, Boolean simplification with transistor sizing, and modified-gate diffusion input (m-GDI) logic in Cadence Virtuoso\u00ae software, based on Silterra 180 nm technology. The study aims to compare and analyze different techniques for reducing latency and power consumption in 4-bit RCA circuits, particularly using Boolean simplification, Boolean simplification with transistor sizing and m-GDI. The following four 1-bit FAs are considered: Basic FA (FA_1), Boolean simplified FA (FA_2), Boolean simplified with transistor sizing FA (FA_3), and m-GDI FA (FA_4). These FAs are evaluated and analyzed for delay and power consumption. Furthermore, the design of the four 1-bit FAs is integrated into a 4-bit RCA, and its impact on large-scale design is examined. The results indicate that the m-GDI 4-bit RCA (4bit_FA_4) exhibits optimized performance in terms of power consumption and propagation delay. It consumes 285.4 nW of power and achieves the best performance with a propagation delay of 118.845 ps."

    "research_summary": "In the paper a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) dynamic regulator is applied with an extended Kalman filter (EKF), a LQG with fuzzy logic adaptive EKF (FLAEKF), LQG with an EKF and a FLAEKF combined with time delays in the feedback loop for modeling non-minimum phase (NMP) response for control of the end effector with non-collocated sensor and in the feed-forward loop for corrective control of a two-link flexible robot in the tracking of square trajectory task. The system is compared in simulations with a fuzzy logic system (FLS) vibration suppression control system. Results show that FLS adaptive vibration suppression yields higher tracking precision than FLAEKF, EKF or corrective time delays. It is also more effective while maintaining tracking accuracy and reasonable time efficiency than the classical PID controller or advanced adaptive controllers. Recursive nonparametric identification procedure for nonlinear friction in the joints of flexible robot is introduced. Its asymptotic properties are investigated. We discuss nonadaptive and adaptive control strategies for tracking the end effector of a flexible robot with collocated and noncollocated sensors attached at the end effector and 0.5m from the elbow joint. Collocated joint sensors satisfy hyperstability conditions but are unable to capture nonminimum phase (NMP) response which is achieved by noncollocated sensors. Nonadaptive control with collocated and noncollocated sensors results in poor tracking, but adaptive control leads to excellent tracking regardless of sensor location. Nonparametric identification procedure for the flexible robot is also presented and its convergence is discussed."

    "research_summary": "The aim of this paper is to interpret a Light Gradient Boost-based model developed for generic radar classification problems. Light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) being a means of accelerating gradient-boosting decision trees, is apparently helpful in real-time radar-based applications. In this paper, LGBM is developed around statistical features which include the maximum, average, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis, and Shannon entropy of the real-valued vectors. Vectors are complex and real-valued data structures that are generated through the extraction of target range cells along the Doppler dimension at the target range. A conventional Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method has been used to analyze the trained LGBM model, thereby leading to some recommendations for arriving at features that required to be tuned. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), a post-hoc model agnostic XAI method, is used to provide a global explanation by considering the entire set of data instances followed by an explanation with respect to the local impact of particular data instances on the overall score."

    "research_summary": "This paper presents a high-order model-based robust control strategy for a dual-motor road wheel actuating system in a steer-by-wire (SbW) architecture. The system consists of a belt-driven and a pinion-driven motor collaboratively actuating the road wheels through mechanically coupled dynamics. To accurately capture the interaction between actuators, structural compliance, and road disturbances, a four-degree-of-freedom (4DOF) lumped-parameter model is developed. Leveraging this high-order dynamic model, a composite control framework is proposed, integrating feedforward model inversion, pole-zero feedback compensation, and a disturbance observer (DOB) to ensure precise trajectory tracking and disturbance rejection. High-fidelity co-simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and Siemens Amesim validate the effectiveness of the proposed control under various steering scenarios, including step and sine-sweep inputs. Compared to conventional low-order control methods, the proposed approach significantly reduces tracking error and demonstrates enhanced robustness and disturbance attenuation. These results highlight the critical role of high-order modeling in the precision control of dual-motor SbW systems and suggest its applicability in real-time, safety-critical vehicle steering applications."

    "research_summary": "Giant cell arteritis is the most common type of systemic vasculitis. An increased risk of venous thromboembolism has been described in these patients. We report the case of a 79-year-old woman with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica, who presented with left thoracic pain radiating to the neck and scapula plus temporal headache. She had no changes on physical examination, but work-up tests showed increased D-dimer levels and computed tomography pulmonary angiography revealed signs of a chronic/subacute embolism in the right inferior lobe. Anticoagulation with edoxaban was started after 5-day bridging with enoxaparin. Three weeks after the initial diagnosis the headache still persisted and she developed scalp tenderness. Giant cell arteritis was diagnosed and treated with prednisolone, with complete resolution of symptoms. Extensive diagnostic work-up was performed to identify an alternative cause of pulmonary thromboembolism; however, the investigations were negative. This case supports the hypothesis that this type of vasculitis could be related to the occurrence of pulmonary embolism. Welding physics is complex, and therefore the welding parametrization is time-consuming. In manual welding, the \"hand\", the experience, and the best sensor of all (the eyes) can compensate for the difficulties in finding the right settings (welding parameters, robot posture, speed, ...) for a specific weld seam. In robotic welding the robotic arm and the sensors are limited, and the parametrization time escalates. This work aims to develop a flexible welding robotized system, through the introduction of (knowledge-based) decision support for welding parametrization in an advanced robotic work cell, in combination with advanced (collision-free) offline programming and advanced sensing. By selecting a specific application area, structural steel, this work will reduce the degree of complexity during the development, paving the way for the introduction of knowledge-based welding in the robotic arc welding sector. Ludwig\u2019s angina is a deep neck space infection defined as a rapidly progressive bilateral cellulitis of the submandibular space. In spite of being an uncommon entity in developed countries and the reduction of mortality and morbidity due to modern era of antibiotics, improved imaging and airway management, it is still an important and potentially life-threatening condition. The authors present 3 cases of Ludwig\u2019s angina that occurred in a developed country, and that required admission in intensive care unit and extensive surgical and medical treatment."

    "research_summary": "Robotic endoscopic systems provide intuitive control and eliminate radiation exposure, making them a promising alternative to conventional methods. However, the lack of axial force measurement from the robot remains a major challenge, as it can lead to excessive colonic elongation, perforation, or ureteral complications. Although various methods have been proposed in previous studies, limitations such as model dependency, bulkiness, and environmental sensitivity remain challenges that should be addressed before clinical application. In this study, we propose EndoForce, a device designed for intuitive and accurate axial force measurement in endoscopic robotic systems. Inspired by the insertion motion performed by medical doctors during ureteroscopy and gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, EndoForce ensures precise force measuring while maintaining compatibility with clinical environments. The device features a streamlined design, allowing for the easy attachment and detachment of a sterile cover, and incorporates a commercial load cell to enhance cost-effectiveness and facilitate practical implementation in real medical applications. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed EndoForce, physical experiments were performed using a testbed that simulates the ureter. We show that the axial force generated during insertion was measured with high accuracy, regardless of whether the pathway was straight or curved, in a testbed simulating the human ureter. Robots with adaptive morphology can improve interactions with their environment, allowing adaptive functions without complicated control strategies. Inspired by a pufferfish, this paper introduces PufferFace Robot (PFR), a vibration-propelled soft robot with an adaptive design for exploring cavities using simple locomotion strategies. PFR is particularly useful for inspecting centimeter-scale pipeline systems with varying diameters and shapes, which pose substantial challenges. Although recent soft robots using smart materials offer advantages, difficulties remain in handling different pipe sizes, navigating transitions, and managing fluid flow. PFR\u2019s inflatable soft skin is equipped with flexible spikes that create asymmetrical friction under vibrations, propelling the robot forward without feedback control. Its hollow structure allows fluid flow, while a front-mounted camera enhances inspection capabilities. PFR adapts to various pipeline conditions, navigating cavities 1 to 1.5 times its diameter and critical areas such as 90\u00b0 elbows, T-connectors, and high-curvature sections. In specific scenarios, PFR can generate a propulsive force 20 to 35 times its weight. There is growing interest in automating surgical tasks using robotic systems, such as endoscopy for treating gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating the cutting task in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in a simulation-based experimental environment, where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, and show that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor. Flexible surgical robots are emerging as advanced tools for minimally invasive surgeries, offering greater versatility compared to traditional rigid robots. Unlike commercial endoscopes, the overtube should remain fixed to maintain stability, ensure a clear field of view, and allow surgical tools to perform tasks efficiently. While constant curvature bending of the overtube is sufficient for some lesions, certain lesions require the overtube to bend into specific shapes to achieve appropriate positioning. Various methods for creating different bending shapes have been proposed in previous research, typically involving connecting multiple segments. However, this approach complicates control and reduces both space and cost efficiency. This study proposed a conceptual method for adding a shaping tendon to control the bending shape and mathematically analyzed the effect of this shaping tendon, inserted along an arbitrary pat"

    "research_summary": "Background Several studies have focused the relationship between cerebral lesions and gut function that has been defined as \u201cbrain-gut axis.\u201d However, patients with brain damage can also present with different bowel dysfunctions (BDs), frequently observed during rehabilitation stay, such as fecal incontinence, constipation and diarrhea. Limited data has been reported in the literature about the occurrence and management of BDs and no study has yet investigated this issue in patients with severe acquired brain injury (sABI). Aim To investigate basal appraisal regarding BDs issue and therapeutic management in patients with sABI during rehabilitation; interest in examining the issue in depth and improving the knowledge of BDs. Design Cross-sectional. Setting and population Physiatrists or neurologists, 99 in total, working in 33 Italian rehabilitation centers involved in the care of sABI giving a pooled sample of 1835 inpatients. Method On behalf of the SIMFER a s urvey questionnaire consisting of 19 close-ended questions with multiple-choice answers and 1 open-ended question was drafted. Items regarded the respondents\u2019 opinions and experiences regarding the epidemiology and management aspects of BDs in patients with sABI. Survey data were collected anonymously via e-mail between July and October 2023. Results All participants knew BDs, but only 18 (40%) and 19 (42.2%) participants were able to provide a definition of diarrhea and constipation, respectively. Eighteen (40%) participants used specific measurements to evaluate BDs. Variable laboratory and instrumental ascertainments were used in diagnosing diarrhea and 84.4% participants requested specialized consultation. All respondents answered that modality and type of nutrition were important in managing BDs. Thirty-six (80%) respondents considered that BDs might increase the incidence of urinary infections and 53.3% answered that BDs might negatively influence the ventricular peritoneal shunt. Participants (95.5%) agreed that mobilization could improve BDs and considered that BDs might hamper recovery (84.4%). The majority showed interest in increasing their knowledge on the topic. Conclusion The survey detected limited knowledge and uncertainty about epidemiology, definition, and management of BDs in sABI patients, but also interest in exploring and educating oneself on the issue. Future studies should be planned to investigate the burden and the therapeutic strategy to manage BDs. The study has immediate transferability for the National Health Service, as PMIC2020 can be routinely implemented in clinical practice and research to assess stroke patients' needs and outcomes. The updated measures allow more immediate comparisons with international data on stroke rehabilitation. Future research should investigate the PMIC2020 feasibility in other rehabilitation settings and its relevance in predicting stroke rehabilitation needs and outcomes. BACKGROUND: The recovery of walking after stroke is a priority goal for recovering autonomy. In the last years robotic systems employed for Robotic Assisted Gait Training (RAGT) were developed. However, literature and clinical practice did not offer standardized RAGT protocol or pattern of evaluation scales. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to summarize the available evidence on the use of RAGT in post-stroke, following the CICERONE Consensus indications. METHODS: The literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library and PEDro, including studies with the following criteria: 1) adult post-stroke survivors with gait disability in acute/subacute/chronic phase; 2) RAGT as intervention; 3) any comparators; 4) outcome regarding impairment, activity, and participation; 5) both primary studies and reviews. RESULTS: Sixty-one articles were selected. Data about characteristics of patients, level of disability, robotic devices used, RAGT protocols, outcome measures, and level of evidence were extracted. CONCLUSION: It is possible to identify robotic devices that are more suitable for specific phase disease and level of disability, but we identified significant variability in dose and protocols. RAGT as an add-on treatment seemed to be prevalent. Further studies are needed to investigate the outcomes achieved as a function of RAGT doses delivered. BACKGROUND: Many robots are available for gait rehabilitation (BWSTRT and ORET) and their application in persons with SCI allowed an improvement of walking function. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to compare the effects of different robotic exoskeletons gait training in persons with different SCI level and severity. METHODS: Sixty-two studies were included in this systematic review; the study quality was assessed according to GRADE and PEDro\u2019s scale. RESULTS: Quality assessment of included studies ( n = 62) demonstrated a prevalence of evidence level 2; the quality of the studies was higher for BWSTRT (excellent and good) than for ORET (fair and good).

    "research_summary": "Fiats provides a platform for research on the training and deployment of neural-network surrogate models for computational science. Fiats also supports exploring, advancing, and combining functional, object-oriented, and parallel programming patterns in Fortran 2023. As such, the Fiats name has dual expansions: \u201cFunctional Inference And Training for Surrogates\u201d or \u201cFortran Inference And Training for Science.\u201d Fiats inference and training procedures are pure and therefore satisfy a language constraint imposed on procedure invocations inside Fortran\u2019s parallel loop construct: do concurrent. Furthermore, the Fiats training procedures are built around a do concurrent parallel reduction. Several compilers can automatically parallelize do concurrent on Central Processing Units (CPUs) or Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Fiats thus aims to achieve performance portability through standard language mechanisms. This paper provides an overview of the multi-image parallel features in Fortran 2023 and their implementation in the LLVM flang compiler and the Caffeine parallel runtime library. The features of interest support a Single-Program, Multiple-Data (SPMD) programming model based on executing multiple \u201cimages\u201d, each of which is a program instance. The features also support a Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) in the form of \u201ccoarray\u201d distributed data structures. The paper discusses the lowering of multi-image features to the Parallel Runtime Interface for Fortran (PRIF) and the implementation of PRIF in the Caffeine parallel runtime library. This paper also provides an early view into the design of a new multi-image dialect of the LLVM Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR). We describe validation and testing of the resulting software stack, and demonstrate that performance compares favorably to another open-source compiler and runtime library: GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) gfortran and OpenCoarrays, respectively."

    "research_summary": "Bifunctional electrocatalysts are in demand to pursue dual functions in applications like energy conversion and pollution treatment. In this study, we synthesize the iron-copper-nickel sulfide (FeCuNiS) catalysts with partial amorphous character via the hydrothermal method. The iron rich composition with optimal copper and nickel ratios exhibits robust performances on hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline conditions. The partial amorphous feature offers more active sites for reaction due to the partial disordered structure. The partially amorphous FeCuNiS exhibits lower overpotential for HER and OER at 50 mAcm<sup>- 2</sup>. Moreover, all compositions were found to be electrocatalytically stable. The optimum design and synthesis strategy of the partially amorphous bifunctional electrocatalysts provided in this work will open pathways to advanced electrocatalysts for energy conversion applications. The snow and glacier-fed Swat River Basin (SRB), located in the Hindukush region of Pakistan, plays a vital role in supporting ecosystems and downstream communities. However, the basin is highly vulnerable to climate change, as evidenced by frequent historical floods. This study simulated historical and future snowmelt runoff using the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM), integrated with an enhanced MODIS snow and glacier product (MOYDGL06*), along with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and hydro-meteorological data. The model was calibrated and validated over 2005\u20132009 and 2011\u20132015, respectively, using basin-wide and zone-wise simulation approach. The key findings of the study indicated: 1) SRM coupled with the improved snow product effectively simulated daily river discharge, achieving mean Nash\u2013Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.90\u20130.91 and Volume Differences (D v ) of 0.51% to \u20131.31% during calibration, and NSE of 0.84\u20130.87 with D v of \u20130.83% to \u20132.27% during validation. The basin-wide approach performed more consistently due to integrated hydrological representation and lower parameter uncertainty. 2) Future projections under three RCP scenarios indicate increases of ~8\u201318% (2046\u20132065) and ~7\u201334% (2081\u20132100) in mean annual flow and increases of ~7\u201316% and ~7\u201330% in mean summer flow, respectively. An increase of 1 \u00b0C in temperature is projected to enhance both seasonal and annual flows by about 6\u20137%. These projected increases are primarily attributed to enhanced snow and glacier melt due to rising temperatures. The findings emphasize the need for adaptive strategies in water resources management and flood risk mitigation in the study area, especially under changing climatic conditions."

    "research_summary": "The \"Made in Italy\" brand exemplifies a harmonious fusion of innovation and tradition within its manufacturing clusters. Support from European initiatives aimed at digitalization has facilitated strategic entry into international markets, thereby enhancing competitiveness. The emergence of Industry 5.0 serves as a framework for optimizing operational efficiency while preserving intrinsic values, enabling manufacturers to adapt to changing consumer demands. Industry 5.0 emphasizes the synergy between advanced technologies and human creativity, prioritizing sustainable practices and personalized production. The furniture sector represents a compelling case study within this context. It is characterized by clusters of small and medium-sized enterprises, often family-run and semi-industrial in nature. These companies combine artisanal knowledge with industrial processes and have embraced digitalization through the development of digital archives for artefacts and component assemblies integrated within Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. Central to this evolution is the development of Product Service Systems (PSS), which integrate digital technologies into product configuration and customization processes. These strategies not only enhance tailored consumer experiences but also strengthen brand loyalty. Additionally, innovative product display systems and storytelling techniques, leveraging virtual support driven by digital processes, engage consumers more effectively. This multifaceted approach illustrates how traditional craftsmanship can evolve through technological advancements, ensuring the sustainability and global relevance of the Made in Italy identity. This strategy involves creating interactive systems that foster screen-based interactions in information dissemination and customization processes. It also addresses immersive product display systems, utilizing new concepts in exhibition design both in situ, such as at trade fairs or exhibitions, and through novel digital platforms that develop interactive, multimodal virtual environments. The research presents several case studies that illustrate the application of this approach in the furniture design sector. It examines PSS strategies and immersive spaces designed to convey technical and emotional information about products. This study explores how mocked explainable AI (xAI) decision support system and Augmented Reality (AR) impact clinicians' trust and performance in Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) imaging. A cohort of 24 Emergency Medicine clinicians assessed three xAI modalities alongside an AR interface. The study found that detailed xAI explanations gained the highest trust and decision accuracy. AR-based decision support was also viewed as innovative, but potentially distracting. Further studies with larger sample sizes in real clinical settings are required to validate these findings."

    "research_summary": "We compare the multipartite entangling and disentangling powers of unitary operators by assessing their ability to generate or eliminate genuine multipartite entanglement. Our findings reveal that while diagonal unitary operators can exhibit equal entangling and disentangling powers, certain non-diagonal unitaries demonstrate an imbalance when acting on fully separable states, thereby extending the known disparity from bipartite systems to those with any number of parties. Counterintuitively, we construct classes of unitaries and their adjoints that display unequal entanglement generation capacities, behaving differently when applied to systems with an even number of qubits compared to those with an odd number. Further, we illustrate that this asymmetry can be simulated using physically realizable Hamiltonians: systems with an even number of qubits employ nearest-neighbor Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions, while those with an odd number utilize a combination of Heisenberg and DM interactions. Additionally, we present a circuit composed of random noncommuting unitaries, constructed from alternating layers of two-qubit Haar-random gates, to illustrate the discrepancy in the entangling and disentangling capabilities of unitaries. This paper examines the critical role of antivirus software in combating malware while addressing the growing challenges posed by sophisticated evasion techniques. It explores various antivirus detection methods, including signature-based, heuristic, and behavior-based analyses, alongside advanced evasion strategies employed by attackers, such as process injection, code obfuscation, and privilege escalation. The theoretical background provides insights into the evolution of malware and the limitations of conventional detection approaches. The methodology outlines how these evasion techniques operate, supported by an analysis section that presents graphs and charts illustrating their effectiveness, particularly in malware types like worms. The findings indicate that current antivirus solutions struggle against multi-stage and adaptive malware, highlighting the urgent need for more dynamic security measures. The paper concludes by discussing future directions for research and improvements in antivirus strategies to effectively counter the evolving threat landscape. Abstract Aim To test the efficaciousness of the 10 warning signs of Jeffrey Modell Foundation (JMF) and routine laboratory tests in predicting Primary Immunodeficiencies (PIDs). Methods Hospitalized children &lt;12 years age satisfying at least two of 10 warning signs were subjected to routine and confirmatory tests. Results Of 35 204 admitted patients, 66 satisfied the JMF criteria and 34 had PID. Also, 59% were infants, with a female preponderance. The most common immunodeficiency disorder group were antibody deficiencies and phagocyte defects (35.3%). Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) was the commonest overall (29.4%). The need for intravenous antibiotics was the most sensitive (91%) criterion for predicting PID. When combined with positive family history of PID, sensitivity (94%) increased further. The two most specific indicators were recurrent ear infections (88%), and family history of PID (88%). The best positive predictor was family history of PID (69%), and the best negative predictor was recurrent sinus infections (58%). Significant association was found between persistent oral thrush and PID ( p .043), and insufficient weight gain and antibody deficiencies ( p .037). Absolute neutrophil count, CRP, and elevated ESR were also significantly associated with PIDs ( p \u2010values being .036, .011, and .014 respectively). Conclusion Out of all 10 JMF criteria, the three most important ones to predict PID were need for IV antibiotics, family history of PID, and recurrent ear infections. Background: Alcoholism is one of the significant problems in India. It is a chronic progressive and often fatal disease but it has not a symptom like other diseases or emotional problems. Prolonged heavy use of alcohol is the cause of addiction. For this addiction higher anxiety level, depression, low self-esteem and communication apprehension have been reported in spouses of alcoholics and attributed to intense, stress and traumas experiences. [1] The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates (9th May 2022) that there are about Worldwide, 3 million deaths every year result from harmful use of alcohol. This represents 5.3% of all deaths. The excessive use of alcohol is one of the main causes of more than 200 disease and injury conditions. Overall, 5.1% of the global burden of disease and injury is attributable to alcohol, as measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). A cause of death and disability relatively early in life is alcohol consumption. In people aged 20\u201339 years, approximately 13.5% of total deaths are attributable to alcohol.

    "research_summary": "Whenever a voltage potential is present between two points - in close enough proximity - for a human or an animal to bridge the gap between them, there is the possibility for current to flow through the body. For the purposes of this paper, the contact scenarios of interest are limited to publicly or privately accessible locations such as swimming pools, hot tubs, pipe lines, street lights, electric service boxes and other areas where electric shock complaints are reported. This paper supplies a review of the literature on human and animal response to ac current along with a review of the standards and documents that presently have published values for voltage, current, or resistance. These documents prove useful in understanding the establishment of published limits and levels of concern. A methodology is described whereby new levels of interest for contact scenarios may be developed using a systematic process that follows the basic methodology applied in establishment of prior limits. Modeling NEV issues requires the most detailed circuit models for distribution system analysis except for, perhaps, lightning surge protection analysis. A proposed line model benchmark is solved and results reported. Modeling NEV will become an increasingly important problem. Based on the proliferation of harmonic producing loads in residential environments, the amount of triplen harmonics will tend to increase, with an accompanying increase in neutral-earth voltages. Nuisance shocking - the unpleasant sensation that a person or animal can experience when they inadvertently get between an energized point and ground can be something of a mystery. Stories are told of cows that won't give milk, dogs that bark out in the yard whenever the phone rings, and people getting an unusual wake up call when they step into their hot tub or back-yard pool. However, despite the esoteric nature of nuisance shocking, the science necessary for understanding it and mitigating it has advanced significantly in recent years. Also, the various mechanisms that can lead to nuisance shocking are now better recognized. Contact voltage, stray voltage, elevated neutral-to-earth voltage, and metallic object-to-earth voltage, are some of the unique terms used to describe nuisance shocking. This paper provides a brief history of the phenomenon of nuisance shocking with several case studies. In addition, this paper also examines the techniques for diagnosing nuisance shocking problems and follows with a discussion of the traditional techniques for mitigating nuisance shocking problems. The range of sources as well as the frequency components for elevated neutral-to-earth and metallic-object-to-earth voltage concerns make it difficult to have just one standardized measurement protocol. The measurement devices and procedures for assessing elevated NEV levels at animal contact areas, distribution substations, pipelines, swimming pools and other contact points range from harmonics analyzers to oscilloscopes to simple multi-meters. For energized street level metallic objects the measurement devices can range from simple pen lights to custom designed equipment, while the protocols vary from precise documentation of voltage levels to simple detection of energized metallic objects. We discusses the variables of interest surrounding accurate and consistent detection and measurement of any elevated voltage levels. This includes: instrumentation, time of day, seasonal patterns, and remote earth or ground reference selection points. Further, suggested initiation points for measurement protocols created via the standards development process are discussed. Efforts in the measurement protocol areas will insure that under situations where higher than expected voltage levels are present at human or animal contact points, the measurements taken to support these efforts are accurate and comprehensive of the range of elevated voltage that may exist at a given point"

    "research_summary": "The existing requirements frameworks or models cater to the existing practices. However, they fall short in directly using them for Cyber informed engineering. Therefore, this paper develops and presents a comprehensive framework that can be used for Cyber informed Engineering during the requirements phase. We describe the existing requirements process and models, then develop a requirements framework for cyber informed engineering. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles as a service (UAVaaS) has increased the field deployment of Robotic Aerial Vehicles (RAVs) for different services such as transportation and terrain exploration. These RAVs are controlled by firmware, which is often closed-source, developed by vendors, and flashed into the ROM. While these binary blobs enable off-the-shelf management of RAVs, end users (individuals or organizations) have no idea if the control firmware is designed and implemented correctly, and can only rely on firmware updates from vendors when any vulnerability is discovered. This paper proposes DisPatch, the first reverse engineering and patching framework for understanding and improving controller design and implementation within RAV firmware. DisPatch first decompiles binary instructions and recovers controller functions and core controller variables by combining control theory with program analysis using symbolic execution and data flow analysis. End users can then write a patch in a domain-specific language (DSL), which will be translated and injected into the binary firmware by DisPatch automatically. We have applied DisPatch to two instances of commodity firmware from3DR IRIS+ and MantisQ RAVs and demonstrated 100% and 80.7% accuracy respectively in the controller decompilation. We have also shown the ability to prevent severe controller performance degradation by patching two real-world bugs with in the firmware and without breaking other functionality. Finally, we show that DisPatch introduces less than 0.53% of space overhead and 1.48% of runtime overhead without violating the soft real-time deadlines. DisPatch provides the first step towards an RAV binary firmware reverse engineering and patching system to customize controller design and implementation. Rapid prototyping makes additive manufacturing (or 3D printing) useful in critical application domains such as aerospace, automotive, and medical. The rapid expansion of these applications should prompt the examination of the underlying security of 3D printed objects. In this paper, we present Mystique, a novel class of stealthy attacks on printed objects that leverage the fourth dimension of emerging 4D printing technology to introduce embedded logic bombs through manufacturing process manipulation. Mystique enables visually benign objects to behave maliciously upon the activation of the logic bomb during operation. It leverages the manufacturing process to embed a physical logic bomb that can be triggered with specific stimuli to change the physical and mechanical properties of the printed objects. These changes in properties can potentially cause catastrophic operational failures when the objects are used in critical applications such as drones, prosthesis, or medical applications. STereoLithography (STL) files describe the geometry of objects to be printed in additive manufacturing. Previous studies have shown that the STL files that describe functional objects can be attacked such that the objects appear normal during inspection, but fail during operation. Such attacks lead to damage to systems that use the objects and possibly loss of life. The detection of any defects caused due to the attacks nowadays is limited to the quality control process after the objects are manufactured.We present a Trusted Integrity Verifier (TIV) to detect such attacks on 3D printed objects in the early stage of the manufacturing process. These type of new attacks cannot be detected by traditional software security mechanisms since they only focus on the printers and do not consider the inputs (STL design files) to the printer. Early detection of attacks prevents from printing malicious objects resulting in saving time, resources and manufacturing efforts. TIV detects malicious STL files using multidisciplinary approaches unlike the traditional integrity verification techniques. TIV develops a void detection module based on computer vision techniques to identify the internal defects such as voids. Some of these features could be from the design and some could be due to the attack. To differentiate the malicious features from the design features, TIV develops safety verification module based on a numerical method. TIV's safety verification module is used to differentiate the malicious features from the design features by calculating the load bearing mechanical stress on the objects. These mechanical stresses are compared to the safety operational conditions to determine if the printed object will break or fail during its normal operation.To il"

    "research_summary": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and neural network architectures has created new opportunities to address long-standing gaps in technical education, particularly in disciplines that require a convergence of theoretical knowledge and applied problem-solving. This research explores how AI-driven neural networks can serve as an educational and technological bridge between two traditionally distinct but increasingly interconnected domains: image processing and Very Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) design. Both fields demand advanced analytical skills, computational proficiency, and a strong grasp of mathematical modeling, yet educational programs often compartmentalize them, limiting interdisciplinary learning and innovation. The study investigates the pedagogical and practical potential of deploying neural network models to enhance teaching, learning, and application within these areas. For image processing, AI-based systems are capable of simplifying complex tasks such as noise reduction, edge detection, and object recognition, making them more accessible to students and researchers. In VLSI design, neural networks are increasingly employed for tasks such as fault detection, circuit optimization, and power efficiency modeling, providing learners with exposure to cutting-edge design methodologies. By embedding AI-driven tools into academic curricula and laboratory practices, this research demonstrates how students can gain holistic insights into both theoretical constructs and real-world applications, thereby narrowing the gap between academic learning and industry expectations. The paper presents a comparative analysis of case studies and experimental modules where neural networks were applied to problem-solving in both domains. The results suggest that AI-driven platforms significantly enhance comprehension, facilitate interactive learning, and encourage cross-disciplinary innovation. Moreover, the integration of neural networks provides learners with hands-on exposure to transferable skills such as algorithm design, model training, and performance evaluation, which are essential for addressing the evolving demands of industries reliant on computational intelligence. Ultimately, this research emphasizes that leveraging neural networks not only strengthens the academic foundation of students in image processing and VLSI but also fosters a multidisciplinary mindset that is vital for the future of technical education. By bridging isolated domains through AI-enabled methodologies, the study highlights a sustainable framework for developing adaptive, industry-ready professionals capable of driving innovation at the intersection of computer science, electronics, and engineering design. Digital banking fraud has grown into a multifaceted threat requiring both strong cryptographic protections and advanced machine learning defenses. This paper proposes a unified framework integrating lattice-based cryptography (for post-quantum resilience and privacy) with federated graph neural networks (for collaborative fraud detection) to address the gap in current financial security architectures. We simulate real-world fraud scenarios \u2013including synthetic identity schemes and transaction laundering \u2013 using a mix of publicly reported incidents (e.g., the 2023 Log4Shell exploitation, 2022 SolarWinds-style supply chain compromise, and the Mirai botnet\u2019s IoT spread) as motivating cases. Our methodology leverages threshold homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving analytics, along with adversarial training and diffusion purification to harden models against poisoning and evasion attacks. Experiments using a mixed dataset of EU banking transactions and simulated breach logs show that our approach achieves over 99% accuracy in detecting novel fraud patterns, while reducing false positives by 35% compared to conventional classifiers. We validate these improvements with statistical significance (p&lt;0.001) and illustrate them via ROC curves and network topology maps. Key findings include the identification of specific trade-offs between cryptographic overhead and detection latency, and the observation that cross-institutional intelligence sharing (using zero-knowledge proofs) can halve the response time to coordinated attacks. These results suggest that combining cryptography with machine learning can close existing vulnerabilities in digital banking and guide future work in robust, privacy-aware fraud prevention. As the Department of Defense (DoD) of various countries integrates AI/ML into the battlefield and autonomous systems, adversarial threats\u2014malicious inputs crafted to deceive models\u2014pose critical risks. This paper reviews adversarial machine learning principles and defense mechanisms with a focus on defense-relevant use cases (battlefield surveillance, autonomous vehicles, edge ML). We discuss trending topics such as adversarial training, data poisoning, model evasion, explainable-AI (XAI) methods for a"

    "research_summary": "Contrails are condensation trails left behind by aircraft at high altitudes when hot exhaust gases mix with cold air, causing water vapor from engine exhaust to freeze into ice crystals, can persist and evolve into cirrus clouds. This study investigates the impact of the aviation industry on contrail formation and its effect on global warming using a physics-based algorithm called Contrail Cirrus Prediction Model (CoCiP) with 2019 airline data. The aviation climate impact due to major greenhouse mechanisms is analyzed from an in-service fleet-level perspective to uncover the impact on global energy forcing due to factors such as aircraft market class, operator region, origin-destination pair, and more. To assess the overall credit risk of a portfolio, it is important to consider the risk correlation between the counterparties (obligors) in addition to their individual credit risks. However, the estimation of the default correlations between obligors is challenging due to the scarcity of data and a lack of reporting default events as common practice. A constrained two-factor Merton correlation model with homogeneous risk classes has been proposed in the literature to achieve a balance between simplicity and usefulness. Yet, the assumption that assets are classified by two risk factors is practically oversimplified. Therefore, in this paper we extend the two-factor Merton correlation model into a three-factor Merton model to more realistically represent real-world practice. The maximum likelihood estimation and the grid search estimation methods for calibration are discussed in detail. For validation, we evaluate the robustness and stability of model parameters estimated from both methods on simulated and real-world default data. We also adopt the bootstrap approach to address the small sample size challenge of real-world data. The proposed model allows us to reveal the additional risk specification without sacrificing estimation accuracy. In addition, we present a convergence analysis to provide guidance on the number of observations to ensure stability of the calibrated maximum likelihood estimation. Abstract Copulas are mathematical tools for modeling joint probability distributions. In the past 60 years they have become an essential analysis tool on classical computers in various fields. The recent finding that copulas can be expressed as maximally entangled quantum states has revealed a promising approach to practical quantum advantages: performing tasks faster, requiring less memory, or, as we show, yielding better predictions. Studying the scalability of this quantum approach as both the precision and the number of modeled variables increase is crucial for its adoption in real-world applications. In this paper, we successfully apply a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) based approach to modeling 3-and 4-variable copulas on trapped ion quantum computers. We study the training of QCBMs with different levels of precision and circuit design on a simulator and a state-of-the-art trapped ion quantum computer. We observe decreased training efficacy due to the increased complexity in parameter optimization as the models scale up. To address this challenge, we introduce an annealing-inspired strategy that dramatically improves the training results. In our end-to-end tests, various configurations of the quantum models make a comparable or better prediction in risk aggregation tasks than the standard classical models. Quantum computers are emerging as a viable alternative to tackle certain computational problems that are challenging for classical computers. With the rapid development of quantum hardware such as those based on trapped ions, there is practical motivation for identifying risk management problems that are efficiently solvable with these systems. Here we focus on network partitioning as a means for analyzing risk in critical infrastructures and present a quantum approach for its implementation. It is based on the potential speedup quantum computers can provide in the identification of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of sparse graph Laplacians, a procedure which is constrained by time and memory on classical computers."

    "research_summary": "Abstract To reduce the harmful emissions from energy generation efficient use of the available sources of fuel is vital. In this current work hydrogen dilution with methane, ethanol, and ammonia is considered to comparatively study the effect of these fuel blend on combustion characteristics. Each of these fuels are potential sources of energy with certain limitations either in efficiency or emission quality. The mixture composition of 20-80, 50-50, and 90-10 percent hydrogen with methane, ethanol, and ammonia is considered for the comparison. Laminar burning speed (LBS), and ignition delay time (IDT) are calculated numerically for the comparative analysis of these three fuel blends. To predict the influence of hydrogen on emission quality, change of species concentration with temperature is calculated. The IDT is calculated at stoichiometric condition, 1100\u20131900 K temperature and 10 atm pressure. The initial temperature of 400 K and 0.6 to 1.4 equivalence ratio is used for LBS calculations. With the help of sensitivity analysis, the effect of mixture on important reaction is studied. The concentration changes of CO, CO2, NO, and NO2 is compared between various hydrogen blends of different fuel."

    "research_summary": "This article examines strategies for risk management and regulatory compliance in the context of modernizing legacy IT infrastructure. The relevance of the topic arises from the growing need to integrate new technological solutions in environments characterized by limited flexibility, high maintenance costs, and technical debt\u2014factors that contribute to operational, technical, and regulatory risks. The study analyzes the current state of legacy infrastructure, identifies key threats and vulnerabilities, and develops methodological approaches including modular migration, AI-driven analytics, the adoption of cloud technologies, and the integration of advanced security measures to ensure compliance with regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. The scientific novelty lies in proposing a new perspective on integrating strategic planning, change management, and modern security technologies to reduce operational costs and improve business resilience. This perspective emerged through a critical review of existing literature. The author\u2019s hypothesis suggests that a comprehensive approach to modernizing legacy IT infrastructure\u2014grounded in modular transition to cloud solutions and automated security monitoring\u2014will lead to a reduction in risk and an increase in the efficiency of business processes. The findings of this study may be of interest to IT management professionals, risk and compliance officers, and researchers seeking to integrate the latest analytical methods into the evaluation and modernization of inherited IT systems. The presented material is also expected to be useful to other scholars developing theoretical models for managing complex IT environments, as well as to practitioners implementing strategies for mitigating operational and regulatory risks amid continuous technological and legal transformation. Modern trends in the digitalization of management and Ukraine\u2019s European integration course have determined the need to adapt the national accounting and reporting system to international sustainable development reporting standards. The article aims is to identify key areas of modernization of the accounting and reporting system in Ukraine through the integration of global sustainable development standards (CSRD, GRI, ESRS) and the implementation of digital tools (XBRL, iXBRL, blockchain), as well as to study the impact of information technologies on the quality, accessibility and efficiency of preparing various types of reporting. The study implemented a systemic approach that provided a comprehensive analysis of the digital transformation processes of accounting and reporting in the context of implementing international sustainable development standards. The dialectical method of analyzing information sources allowed for identifying the relationships between information technologies and reporting practices. The regulatory and legal assessment was carried out using empirical, comparative, and evaluative methods. The EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), adopted in December 2022, provides new requirements for transparency and disclosure of non-financial information, particularly on aspects of sustainable development. The article assesses the degree of implementation of sustainable development reporting in the European Union and Ukraine, considering the key characteristics of the regulatory environment, standards, format, and mandatory submission, as well as the organizational support for sustainable development reporting in both jurisdictions. The results of the study showed that in Ukraine, against the background of positive dynamics of digitalization, such challenges as fragmentation of regulatory support, limited adaptation of IT infrastructure to new formats, shortage of specialists with knowledge of XBRL/ESG reporting, weak interaction between regulators, software developers, and reporting entities, hinder the full implementation of European reporting standards. In addition, a significant part of small and medium-sized enterprises requires methodical and technical support to transition to new standards and formats for reporting data transmission. The study suggests several measures that need to be implemented to successfully integrate international sustainable development standards and digital tools into Ukraine's accounting system. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into cloud computing and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) is crucial for achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time capabilities in modern ecosystems. Containerization enhances AI deployment by improving portability, resource efficiency, and system isolation. This article addresses key design considerations and challenges in implementing con- tainerized AI within cloud-native and CPS environments, focusing on scalability, fault tolerance, real-time respon- siveness, and security. Through research analysis and case studies, it explores strategies for optimizing AI workload distribution across clo"

    "research_summary": "Identity protection is an essential component of enterprise security in the current era. With phishing, credential theft, and adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) attacks persisting and morphing, traditional authentication methods like passwords and omnipresent multi-factor authentication (SMS, OTP, push notification, etc.) are proving increasingly inadequate. This article provides an in-depth examination of two modern and popular authentication protocols, namely FIDO2/WebAuthn and Certificate-Based Authentication (CBA). FIDO2 facilitates passwordless authentication with the assistance of cryptographic credentials securely bound to a person's device, offering improved usability and phishing resistance. CBA, rooted in public key infrastructure (PKI), remains a necessary requirement in compliance-focused environments and is crucial for safeguarding human and machine identities. This study explores how these technologies operate across diverse contexts, from enterprise-owned notebooks to personal mobile devices and non-human account systems. Using internationally accepted standards and frameworks\u2014such as NIST SP 800-63-3, the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model, and eIDAS\u2014the document provides implementation considerations that incorporate policy and identity credential lifecycle approach techniques. It also evaluates operational recovery and fallback processes in cases of credential loss or compromise. A structured framework is provided to enable organizations to achieve identity assurance at scale and support evolving technology and regulatory demands. Future trends such as passkeys, derived credentials, quantum computing, and modular authentication systems are also considered, which will introduce flexibility and strength in the identity assurance landscape. Abstract: This research paper explores the impact of chatting app features on user engagement and satisfaction using a usercentered design approach. The study involved conducting interviews with users to identify their preferences for features and conducting user testing to evaluate the impact of specific features on user engagement and satisfaction. The results show that certain features such as privacy and security, design and usability, multimedia sharing, emojis and stickers, and group chats and collaboration have a significant impact on user engagement and satisfaction. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of these findings for the design of chatting apps and providing recommendations for future research in this area. We have reported the measurement of third-order optical nonlinearity by antiresonant ring interferometric nonlinear spectroscopic (ARINS) technique and discussed its usefulness over other popular measuring techniques such as Z-scan, degenerate four wave mixing (DFWM) and third harmonic generation (THG). The measurement has been simulated theoretically by taking different numerical values as well as sign of \u03b4, which is a key parameter of ARINS. The technique has been benchmarked using toluene and the theoretical simulation has been substantiated experimentally by measuring the nonlinear optical coefficients (n 2 and \u03b2) of two different samples. The disadvantages of the technique have also been discussed. However, a number of advantages of ARINS override its disadvantages and therefore, ARINS may be preferred over other measuring techniques for the measurement of nonlinear optical parameters."

    "research_summary": "As data becomes the most critical digital asset in the modern enterprise, traditional security approaches struggle to keep pace with the evolving threat landscape and fragmented data environments. Data Security Posture Management (DPSM) emerges as a transformative strategy that enables organizations to gain continuous visibility, assess risks, and enforce security policies across structured and unstructured data\u2014whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in hybrid ecosystems. This article presents a unified and adaptive DPSM framework that integrates discovery, classification, access governance, risk prioritization, and automated remediation. By aligning with zero-trust principles and leveraging AI-driven analytics, the proposed approach enhances data security resilience, ensures regulatory compliance, and reduces the attack surface across the entire data lifecycle. Through real-world use cases and implementation insights, the article demonstrates how DPSM empowers security teams to proactively safeguard sensitive information in today\u2019s dynamic, data-centric landscape. The COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly accelerated the shift to remote work, permanently altering organizational dynamics. As businesses and employees adapted to a remote-first environment, they also became exposed to a new set of cybersecurity threats. The traditional cybersecurity measures designed for office environments are no longer sufficient to address the unique risks associated with remote work. These risks include vulnerabilities in home networks, unsecured devices, increased susceptibility to phishing and social engineering attacks, and the rapid adoption of cloud-based collaboration tools. This paper will explore the cybersecurity challenges posed by remote work and suggest proactive steps organizations can take to safeguard their data, assets, and personnel. Key strategies, including enhanced endpoint security, secure communication channels, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), security awareness training, and Zero Trust architecture, will be discussed to help organizations minimize their exposure to these emerging risks. In an increasingly digital world, aligning cybersecurity measures with organizational goals is essential for businesses to thrive and protect their critical assets. Cybersecurity in Sync with Business: Aligning Security Measures with Organizational Goals explores the strategic integration of security controls into the core functions of an organization. This alignment ensures that cybersecurity is not seen as a standalone IT concern but as a crucial enabler of business success, resilience, and growth. The article delves into how businesses can tailor their cybersecurity strategies to support their unique objectives, such as operational efficiency, customer trust, and market competitiveness. By examining risk management, secure infrastructure design, and proactive threat intelligence, the article highlights best practices for harmonizing security with organizational priorities. It also emphasizes the importance of fostering collaboration between security teams and business leaders to ensure that security measures are not disruptive but instead enable innovation and agility. Ultimately, this article provides practical insights into how organizations can align cybersecurity measures with their business goals, ensuring that security becomes a competitive advantage and an integral part of their long-term strategy. Through this approach, organizations can mitigate risks, enhance their operational resilience, and safeguard both their digital and physical infrastructures in the face of evolving threats. Underwater geodesy is important for marine studies and seafloor mapping. These studies typically make use of the time of flight, for example SONAR, and collect a lot of data. Furthermore, high map densities require big data collection and transportation, and therefore require high bandwidth underwater networks. In this article, we propose and demonstrate an underwater optical network based on a directly-modulated laser at 650 nm that enables the deployment of underwater robotic systems which are capable of transferring the captured data to a base station and allow the synchronization of the clocking signals. As proof of concept, we demonstrated a unipolar NRZ data transfer from an Arduino at 2 Mbps through an underwater channel measuring about 1 meter in length. A bit error rate value of about 10 \u2212 5 for underwater data transmission was realised by the designed optical network, showcasing its potential for use in underwater data transfer during robotic geodesy surveys. Recovery of the clock signal from the signal generator at 2 kHz was also shown. Phase noise floor values below \u221290 dBc/Hz were attained for the underwater clock signal transmission."

    "research_summary": "This paper provides a comprehensive examination of ransomware behavior on Windows endpoints, exploring the intrusion mechanisms, proliferation methods, and the mitigating strategies that can be employed. It provides a comparative analysis of several ransomware families and their effects on Windows systems, culminating with suggestions for future research directions in enhancing endpoint security against ransomware attacks. In the wake of a rising number of ransomware attacks worldwide, epitomized by the damaging disruptions to the Colonial Pipeline and the Irish Health Service Executive, the persistent threat of ransomware to critical infrastructure has never been more apparent. While Windows endpoints remain primary targets, these attacks have also highlighted a less explored but crucial aspect of ransomware behavior: the exploitation of Application Programming Interface (API) calls integral to the Windows operating system. This comprehensive study provides an exhaustive investigation into the interplay between ransomware and Windows APIs, emphasizing the patterns of invocation and manipulative misuse by various ransomware families. By investigating specific API calls, such as the CryptEncrypt function in the Cryptography API for encryption, and the CreateFile and WriteFile functions in the File API for file system interaction, we illuminate the mechanisms by which ransomware carry out their damaging actions. Further, using the real-world examples drawn from the Colonial Pipeline and Irish Health Service Executive incidents, among others, the study shows how these API calls were manipulated during actual ransomware attacks. In these cases, ransomware like DarkSide and Conti used Windows APIs not just for the primary tasks of encryption and file system manipulation, but also for achieving network communication, maintaining persistence, and even thwarting detection. By presenting a comparative analysis of API call sequences in both benign and ransomware-infected Windows environments, this study serves as a critical exploration into the behavior of these malicious entities. The different patterns observed provide us with valuable insights into their operational strategies and offer opportunities for the development of detection heuristics. The insights derived from this research contribute significantly to our understanding of the behavior patterns of recent, high-profile ransomware attacks. In turn, this work aims to guide the evolution of more sophisticated, behavior-based detection mechanisms, thus strengthening the security posture of Windows endpoints. Ultimately, this study underscores the need for continuous research into API call patterns, as the cybersecurity landscape continues to face dynamic and increasingly sophisticated threats. Crypto ransomware is malware that locks its victim\u2019s file for ransom using an encryption algorithm. Its popularity has risen at an alarming rate among the cyber community due to several successful worldwide attacks. The encryption employed had caused irreversible damage to the victim\u2019s digital files, even when the victim chose to pay the ransom. As a result, cybercriminals have found ransomware a lucrative and profitable cyber-extortion approach. The increasing computing power, memory, cryptography, and digital currency advancement have caused ransomware attacks. It spreads through phishing emails, encrypting sensitive data, and causing harm to the designated client. Most research in ransomware detection focuses on detecting during the encryption and post-attack phase. However, the damage done by crypto-ransomware is almost impossible to reverse, and there is a need for an early detection mechanism. For early detection of crypto-ransomware, behavior-based detection techniques are the most effective. This work describes RENTAKA, a framework based on machine learning for the early detection of crypto-ransomware. The features extracted are based on the phases of the ransomware lifecycle. This experiment included five widely used machine learning classifiers: Na\u00efve Bayes, kNN, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and J48. This study proposed a pre-encryption detection framework for crypto-ransomware using a machine learning approach. Based on our experiments, support vector machines (SVM) performed with the best accuracy and TPR, 97.05% and 0.995, respectively. Crypto-ransomware is a kind of malware threat, and it is one of approach frequently used by cybercriminals. It is due to the capability to hijack the victim\u2019s files and data by totally encrypting it using sophisticated cryptographic libraries such as OpenSSL and Microsoft Cryptography API. From the ransom note left by the attacker on the infected machine, the victim is told to fulfil the requested payment to get back the files. New variants of ransomware were released from time to time, thus making the task of detecting and analyzing it becomes challenging and resource consuming. Obfuscation and polymorphism employ"

The American jurist Louis Marshall (1856-1929) was widely regarded in his day as one of the country's most significant leaders. Rooted in the patrician and politically conservative German Jewish milieu of the post-Civil War era, Marshall was a prominent New York lawyer who played a highly public and frequently pivotal role as an advocate of legal protections for marginalized individuals and minority groups. Likewise, Marshall's stewardship of American affairs stemmed from a strong combination of self-interest and profound belief in American democracy. He was a formidable legal presence who demonstrated extraordinary juridical talent and an ability to access the levers of American judicial power. His dual role as a communal steward and commanding legal figure raises important historical questions. This article suggests that Marshall's activism and legal approach reveals a curious admixture of political sensitivities that became a hallmark of the American experience."

    "research_summary": "When malware employs an unseen zero-day exploit, traditional security measures such as vulnerability scanners and antivirus software can fail to detect them. This is because these tools rely on known patches and signatures, which do not exist for new zero-day attacks. Furthermore, existing machine learning methods, which are trained on specific and occasionally outdated malware samples, may struggle to adapt to features in new malware. To address this issue, there is a need for a more robust machine learning model that can identify relationships between malware samples without being trained on a particular malware feature set. This is particularly crucial in the field of cybersecurity, where the number of malware samples is limited and obfuscation techniques are widely used. Current approaches using stacked autoencoders aim to remove the noise introduced by obfuscation techniques through reconstruction of the input. However, this approach ignores the semantic relationships between features across different malware samples. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Siamese Neural Network (SNN) that uses relation-aware embeddings to calculate more accurate similarity probabilities based on semantic details of different malware samples. In addition, by using entropy images as inputs, our model can extract better structural information and subtle differences in malware signatures, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques. Evaluations on two large malware sample sets using the N-shot and N-way methods show that our proposed model is highly effective in predicting previously unseen malware, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques. Fluorescent Labeled Bacteria (FLB) Uptake Experiment- whole (unfiltered) seawater (WSW) was collected on the HOE Legacy 2A cruise near station ALOHA, Hawaii. Water was collected from the Niskin into 3, 2.3L bottles. FLBs were added to the bottles, and 100ml was removed and preserved from each bottle at T0. Bottles were incubated on-deck for 1h, at which point another 100ml was preserved from each bottle. Preserved samples were filtered onto 2.0um blackened polycarbonate filters and stained with DAPI. Slides were stored at -20C. Fluorescent Labeled Bacteria (FLB) Uptake Experiment- whole (unfiltered) seawater (WSW) was collected on the HOE Legacy 2A cruise near station ALOHA, Hawaii.

Slides were stored at -20C. Aims to provide the block architecture of CoStar3400 DSP that is a high performance, low power and scalable VLIW DSP core, it efficiently deployed a variable-length execution set (VLES) execution model which utilizes the maximum parallelism by allowing multiple address generations and data arithmetic logic units to execute multiple instructions in a single clock cycle. The scalability was provided mainly in using more or less number of functional units according to the intended application. Low power support was added by careful architectural design techniques such as fine-grain clock gating and activation of only the required number of control signals at each stage of the pipeline. The said features of the core make it a suitable candidate for many SoC configurations, especially for compute intensive applications such as wire-line and wireless communications, including infrastructure and subscriber communications. The embedded system designers can efficiently use the scalability and VLIW features of the core by scaling the number of execution units according to specific needs of the application to effectively reduce the power consumption, chip area and time to market the intended final product. An efficient low complexity H.264 VBSME (variable-block-size motion estimation) VLSI (very large scale integrated) architecture is designed, in which a MB-size input buffer, 17\u00d716 snake scan register array, 8\u00d78 PE array,4\u00d74 SAD-adder-tree are used and a four-step VBS MV generator structure is proposed to reduce the hardware cost for wireless video communication applications. Compared with the MB-level VBSME structure, the total count of gates is reduced to 37%, the delay of critical path is shorten from 9.8 ns to 8.2 ns, and nearly 50.3% power is saved and the main data-path width is narrowed to 25%, but all MB characters are reserved. Its low-hardware-complexity performance makes it suitable for the integration of H.264 encoder in wireless video communication applications."

    "research_summary": "Cyber-attacks such as ransomware, data breaches, and phishing triggered by malware, especially for iOS (iPhone operating system) platforms, are increasing. Yet not much works on malware detection for the iOS platform have been done compared to the Android platform. Hence, this paper presents an iOS malware classification inspired by phylogenetics. It consists of mobile behaviour, exploits, and surveillance features. The new iOS classification helps to identify, detect, and predict any new malware variants. The experiment was conducted by using hybrid analysis, with twelve (12) malwares datasets from the Contagio Mobile website. As a result, twenty-nine (29) new classifications have been developed. One hundred (100) anonymous mobile applications (50 from the Apple Store and 50 from iOS Ninja) have been used for evaluation. Based on the evaluation conducted, 13% of the mobile applications matched with the developed classifications. In the future, this work can be used as guidance for other researchers with the same interest. Security researchers and practitioners face many challenges in mitigating mobile malware attacks against smartphones. Ranges of techniques have been developed by different developers to ensure that smartphones remain free from such attacks. However, we still lack efficient techniques to mitigate mobile malware attacks, especially for the iOS platform. Hence, this paper presents mobile malware classifications based on phylogenetics that can be used for mobile malware detection with regard to the iOS platform. Phylogenetics have been used as the basis concept associated with forming a mobile malware classification based on similar malware behavior, vulnerability exploitation and mobile phone surveillance features that originate from the same family of specific malware practices. A mobile malware classification based on the phylogenetic concept and on mathematical formulations has been developed for this purpose, and proof of the concept has been sought to support this new classification. This research was conducted in a controlled lab environment using open source tools and by applying dynamic analysis. Consequently, this paper can be used as reference for other researchers with the same interest in future."

    "research_summary": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in significant neurological deficits, and curative therapies are lacking. Neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplantation shows promise, as graft-derived neurons (GDNs) can integrate into host spinal cord and support axon regeneration. Here, we examined the synaptic integration of GDNs into hindlimb motor circuits in a mouse thoracic contusion SCI model. Transsynaptic tracing revealed that GDNs form synaptic connections with host motor circuits. Axon mapping showed distinct termination patterns of cholinergic and V2a interneurons within host spinal cord. Chemogenetic activation of GDNs induced muscle activity in a subset of transplanted animals, but NPC transplantation alone did not improve locomotor recovery. These findings indicate that GDNs can integrate into and modulate activity of host circuits, yet limited synaptic connectivity constrains functional recovery. Future studies should enhance graft-host connectivity and refine transplantation strategies to maximize therapeutic benefit for SCI. Abstract Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in significant neurological deficits, with no currently available curative therapies. Neural progenitor cell (NPC) transplantation has emerged as a promising approach for neural repair, as graft-derived neurons (GDNs) can integrate into the host spinal cord and support axon regeneration. However, the mechanisms underlying functional recovery remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the synaptic integration of NPC-derived neurons into locomotor circuits, the projection patterns of distinct neuronal subtypes, and their potential to modulate motor circuit activity. Using transsynaptic tracing in a mouse thoracic contusion SCI model, we found that NPC-derived neurons form synaptic connections with host locomotor circuits, albeit at low frequencies. Furthermore, we mapped the axon projections of V0C and V2a interneurons, revealing distinct termination patterns within host spinal cord laminae. To assess functional integration, we employed chemogenetic activation of GDNs, which induced muscle activity in a subset of transplanted animals. However, NPC transplantation alone did not significantly improve locomotor recovery, highlighting a key challenge in the field. Our findings suggest that while GDNs can integrate into host circuits and modulate motor activity, synaptic connectivity remains a limiting factor in functional recovery. Future studies should focus on enhancing graft-host connectivity and optimizing transplantation strategies to maximize therapeutic benefits for SCI. This paper is a critical review that examines the evolution and impact of cyber diplomacy, with a specific focus on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in shaping international cybersecurity strategies. It explores how AI, driven by advances in data availability, computing power, and algorithms, is transforming cybersecurity by enhancing threat detection and response capabilities while also introducing new risks such as AI-driven cyberattacks. The review highlights the dual role of AI in both advancing and complicating cyber diplomacy and discusses various international frameworks aimed at addressing these challenges. It reinforces the need for a unified global approach to balance AI's benefits with its potential risks and advocates for integrated regional and global cybersecurity efforts to stimulate resilient international cyber diplomacy.

    "research_summary": "Due to the wide application of SCADA systems in national critical infrastructure, their cyber security issues and vulnerabilities have been a primary concern; whereas, the impact and consequences of cyber-attacks to these systems have the potential to result in catastrophic consequences in the physical domain. Therefore, estimating possible attack impacts and identifying system vulnerabilities are major concern in SCADA management and operations. However, it is quite difficult to plan, execute and review vulnerability analysis in critical infrastructure systems as well as in industrial control systems (such as SCADA system) due to its complexity, large-scale and heterogeneity. Consequently, a consistent domain-specific conceptual model is required to establish a generic framework for cyber security analysis to examine and investigate security threats on cyber-physical systems, the role of the entities within the system as well as system operations. The main contribution of this work is to present a multi-facets model to support cyber security analysis practices such as penetration testing, vulnerability assessment and risk analysis. The proposed model presents a common insight among different SCADA configurations, implementations and the employed protocols to handle its complexity, heterogeneous and scale. To demonstrate the usability as a proof of concept and applicability of the proposed model, the paper also presents an example illustrating how the proposed model can be employed to carry out security vulnerability assessment."

    "research_summary": "The National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO), and National Governors Association (NGA) hosted a State Energy Justice Roundtable (Roundtable) in April 2022. Participants included federal and state decision-makers, members of community-based organizations, and subject-matter experts. The Roundtable members explored current state efforts to articulate and incorporate energy justice concerns into energy-related decision-making. Participants established connections with one another to better understand the current landscape of existing resources, learn about emerging efforts, and identify ongoing support opportunities for advancing energy justice. This paper is one of five authored by the host organizations on topics that were the focus of the Roundtable. Each paper summarizes key themes, emerging efforts, and group takeaways that were discussed at the Roundtable and should assist state members in developing and meeting their own state goals around energy justice. The papers all include the same discussions of background, introduction, and reading list so they can be read separately. Each paper is written from the perspective of one association and includes options for its members to take actions that could support more equitable state energy policies and programs. The five papers cover: (1) Participation in decision making (NARUC) (2) Customer affordability and arrearages (NARUC) (3) Energy justice metrics (NARUC) (4) Equity in clean energy research and development (NASEO) (5) Equitable distributed energy resource (DER) access (NGA). The resources and recommendations listed in these papers are not meant to be exhaustive, as this field of study continues to evolve. Although this brief is focused on electricity, energy justice considerations extend to all energy needs and services, including the impact of energy extraction, processing, and distribution functions. Physical hazards such as extreme weather, and increasingly, sophisticated cyber threats, jeopardize safe, reliable operation of the power grid in the United States. More than 98 percent of military installations in the nation depend on the civilian power grid to execute military and national security missions around the world. For these installations, power outages can have devastating consequences. Public Utility Commissions are in a unique position to help bring stakeholders together and work to enhance resiliency of this defense critical energy infrastructure. This article examines issues related to defense energy resilience and explores opportunities for PUCs to develop relationships with the Department of Defense to encourage projects that will enhance national security and provide resilience benefits to communities outside the fence line. Effective state\u2010specific examples are highlighted."

    "research_summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini, are reshaping the cyber threat landscape, particularly in the domain of social engineering. These models empower adversaries to automate, personalize, and scale phishing, impersonation, and business email compromise (BEC) attacks with unprecedented realism. Unlike traditional social engineering techniques, LLM-driven threats can adapt to contextual cues, simulate executive communication patterns, and generate deepfake audio or video to enhance credibility. As such, conventional security awareness programs and static detection mechanisms are proving insufficient against the sophistication and speed of these AI-enabled attacks. This paper investigates the role of generative AI in enabling next-generation social engineering threats and introduces a multi-layered defense strategy. The proposed framework spans technical solutions such as behavioral anomaly detection, AI-driven phishing simulation, and real-time synthetic media analysis as well as human-centric and policy-based countermeasures. Additionally, the study explores adversarial AI, data poisoning, and red teaming as both offensive and defensive mechanisms. Grounded in emerging trends, case studies, and explainable AI (XAI) techniques, this research emphasizes the urgency of adopting adaptive, intelligence-driven cybersecurity practices. The findings aim to inform practitioners and policymakers on building resilient systems capable of detecting, mitigating, and responding to AI-powered social engineering attacks in real time.."

    "research_summary": "In today's digital landscape, organizations are increasingly migrating their operations to the cloud. However, during this shift comes the crucial need for robust security measures. This paper explores the major security challenges organizations face during cloud migration and proposes an effective strategy to mitigate these risks. By building upon existing research, the paper identifies key security challenges and focuses on a proactive approach to address them. The paper delves into the fundamental principles of cloud security, emphasizing the shared responsibility model and the importance of encryption, access controls, identity management, and cloud governance. It highlights the specific security issues encountered during cloud migration. To address these challenges, it advocates for the application of threat modeling\u2014a systematic approach to identify and evaluate potential threats, vulnerabilities, and risks. The benefits of threat modeling include early risk identification, risk prioritization, a security-by-design approach, alignment with standards and best practices, and ongoing security assurance. Practical guidance on implementing threat modeling for a secure cloud migration is provided particularly based on the Microsoft threat modelling approach by identifying and prioritizing potential security threats, implementing effective controls, and validating their effectiveness.

    "research_summary": "In this article titled \"The Legal Framework for Cybersecurity in Nigeria: Adapting the Fourth Industrial Revolution,\" the author explores the legal landscape governing cybersecurity in Nigeria in the context of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). The Fourth Industrial Revolution is characterized by the integration of digital technologies such as the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing, which has created a hyper-connected system. As this revolution progresses, cybersecurity becomes critical to ensuring the security of the digital space. The article emphasizes the need for the legal framework to evolve in line with societal changes brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution. Nigeria's legal framework for cybersecurity must adapt to the challenges posed by the rapid integration of digital technologies and cyber-physical systems in our daily lives. A robust and adaptive legal framework is essential to safeguard national security, protect personal data, and foster a secure digital ecosystem conducive to economic growth and technological advancements. This Article also calls out to the stakeholders, policymakers and the Government of Nigeria to take the necessary steps required for signing the Malabo Convention, as Nigeria is yet to sign the African Union Malabo Convention. This is vital in our steps to adapt to the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
